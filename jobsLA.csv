About L3 ASV:


L3 ASV is an exciting young technology growth company and operation of unmanned maritime vehicles and control systems. We operate in the Military, energy and research sectors and build innovative, technologically advanced products to solve difficult problems.
Our success is due to the people we employ – if you’re smart, adaptable, highly productive, a team player and relish the challenge that comes with solving difficult problems then L3 ASV is for you.
Culture:


Our software developers are a tightly knit group of extremely talented individuals. There's a pervasive desire to do things the right way, even when that takes longer than the easy way. If a developer is stuck or can't decide on the best way to do something, it's common for them to walk down the hall and get someone else's opinion. We practice a meritocracy here: the best idea is the one we use, whether it comes from the project lead or an intern. This means that every individual can have a significant impact on our product and ultimately the success of the company.
We are also firm believers in self-improvement and constant growth: that's why we have monthly ""lunch-and-learn"" gatherings where one developer on our team presents some topic that may be unfamiliar to the rest of us. Examples include an overview of machine learning, computer vision, or the latest C++ standards. We believe that maintaining a solid work/life balance is crucial to the wellbeing of our employees.
Furthermore, we understand the need for a flexible work schedule to deal with unexpected situations. Of course, we also provide all the standard perks–paid sick leave, vacation time, health benefits, and 401k matching.
Key Responsibilities:
Designing, implementing, and maintaining high-performance C++ code in a Linux environment
Using state-of-the-art computer vision and deep learning techniques to perform real-time segmentation, tracking, and classification
Real time video stabilization/motion correction•
Video compression in low bandwidth environments
Fusing data from multiple camera feeds into a consistent world model
Camera setup, integration, and calibration

Culture:


Our software developers are a tightly knit group of extremely talented individuals. There's a pervasive desire to do things the right way, even when that takes longer than the easy way. If a developer is stuck or can't decide on the best way to do something, it's common for them to walk down the hall and get someone else's opinion. We practice a meritocracy here: the best idea is the one we use, whether it comes from the project lead or an intern. This means that every individual can have a significant impact on our product and ultimately the success of the company.
We are also firm believers in self-improvement and constant growth: that's why we have monthly ""lunch-and-learn"" gatherings where one developer on our team presents some topic that may be unfamiliar to the rest of us. Examples include an overview of machine learning, computer vision, or the latest C++ standards. We believe that maintaining a solid work/life balance is crucial to the wellbeing of our employees.
Furthermore, we understand the need for a flexible work schedule to deal with unexpected situations. Of course, we also provide all the standard perks�paid sick leave, vacation time, health benefits, and 401k matching.

Designing, implementing, and maintaining high-performance C++ code in a Linux environment

Users easily exchange payment documents like lien waivers, pay applications, and preliminary notices, they see a complete picture of who is on their job, and are empowered with the resources and knowledge they need to be confident in payment. The results are faster payments and fewer surprises.


All of this activity generates millions of entities, records, attribution, and entity relationships. We use this data to create insights about the payment activity of projects and contractors, which helps our users get paid. That's where you come in.


You'll be Levelset's first Data Scientist and have the opportunity to influence how we expand our data science use cases across the business and products. You will need to be a ""data utility player"" and be prepared to be able to move data around, analyze opportunities, select the tools and build the infrastructure to support data science, and use our data to innovate our product and advance our purpose. The work you do and models you build will have a direct impact on our users.


Types of projects you'll be working on:


Text Analysis and Entity Recognition
We send thousands of documents and ingest thousands more from external sources. This data is messy, sometimes unstructured, and we need to be smarter about how we correlate company entities. How can we tell if two companies with similar names are the same or different?
We are collecting thousands of reviews from our users to capture feedback on different contractors on things like payment timeliness, communication practices, etc… How can we summarize the overall sentiment of reviews for a specific contractor and what are the common pros / cons?
Advanced Analytics and Data Discovery
We have a lot of data on the payment history of contractors. How can we rate the payment risk of a contractor and share that information with users in a helpful, digestible way?
A large commercial construction project can last many years and include hundreds of contractors. Or a single address can have multiple projects over the years with different contractors. Or a property, like an office building, can have different distinct projects going on at one time. How can we tell the difference?
Data Modeling and Heuristics
A user is on a project that we know other subcontractors are experiencing slow payment on. What other documents should we recommend the user do to ensure they get paid?
Most of the construction industry is based on working relationships and prior work history. What relationships and other parties can we infer that are working on the project based on the existing connections from other projects we see in our graph?


Skills you'll need:


1-3 years of experience working with Machine Learning, Optimization, Neural Networks and/or Artificial Intelligence
A broad understanding of data science techniques and a willingness to ""go deep"" and learn more about a specific topic as it relates to our opportunities.
Data cleansing experience using various utilities and programming techniques
Text analytics, natural language processing, and entity recognition / extraction to turn documents into information
Data processing / ETL to prep and clean data for analysis and production pipelines.
R / Python / SQL / Cypher.
You'll be helping us build our DS stack out, but familiarity with the tools we have in place will help, including: MySQL, Redshift/Postgres, Neo4j, Kafka, RabbitMQ, and the AWS stack.


Why Levelset?


Levelset is one of the South's fastest-growing tech companies with 100% growth year over year. Named New Orleans City Business ""Best Place to Work,"" ""Top Company Culture"" by Entrepreneur Magazine, part of the Inc. 5,000 fastest growing companies, and voted best company for leadership, perks and benefits, work-life balance, and professional development as well as best CEO for woman and diversity by Comparably.


We push ourselves to break records and to drive the growth of the company while we celebrate wins and have fun every day. We will invest in you, we will challenge you, and we will push you to grow. You will be surrounded by the best colleagues and given the opportunity to shake up a billion dollar industry.
We care where you will be in 3 years, 5 years, and 10 years and we're invested to help you get there.
You're joining a stellar team where you can have a huge impact and help us change the world.
We have a very competitive health benefits package and a fun office environment.
We have monthly company parties and catered lunch every Wednesday.
We offer unlimited vacation and an annual personal travel stipend.
