About Our Team

Sandia’s Autonomous Sensing and Controls department delivers sensor systems and algorithms for: Detecting or classifying targets; detecting or classifying signals or images; navigating, guiding, and controlling flight bodies, including computing trajectories for hypersonic flights; classifying or segmenting images; and classifying 1-D time-series signals such as vibration, shock, or explosive sound. The department’s unique expertise enables its sensors and control systems to have small size, weight, and power (SWaP). Machine learning is reducing the SWaP even further. The sensors perform signal processing on-board in real time. They are networked and communicate with each other. They are autonomous, requiring no human intervention once deployed. The development encompasses concept, algorithm, prototyping, programming at all levels, testing and qualification, and hardware delivery. The customers are Defense (such as DTRA and DARPA) and Intelligence communities, Homeland Security, and also other groups within Sandia, especially the flight Navigation, Guidance and Control group. The department supports national security missions including nuclear proliferation detection, treaty monitoring, arms control, battlefield and other critical high-reliability missions. The department collaborates extensively with other groups at Sandia, such as Optics, Embedded Systems, Synthetic Aperture Radar, Weapon Components, Geoscience, Robotics, and Satellites. The department staff also perform fundamental research under Sandia’s Laboratory Directed Research and Development program, including the $35M/5yrs Autonomy For Hypersonics Mission Campaign. The department is part of the Autonomy Enterprise within Sandia’s Integrated Military System Development Center.

The Information Sciences Group (CCS-3) at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) has an opening for an outstanding postdoctoral research associate in the areas of computer vision and machine learning for technical images. Computer vision, especially when combined with machine learning methods, has dramatically improved the ability to detect objects in images and semantically segment images for scene understanding. However, these advances have not yet automated the understanding of information contained in hand-drawn figures, technical diagrams, mathematical equations, data plots, and other images conveying technical information, because those types of images contain much less information compared with natural images.

A successful candidate will engage in two or more of the following focus areas:
1) Develop computer vision algorithms for extracting information from drawings, technical diagrams and scientific plots.
2) Develop computer vision algorithms for shape matching across a wide variety of image types including photographs, drawings, diagrams, scanned historic documents, etc.
3) Develop computer vision and machine learning algorithms for image analysis (classification, object detection, segmentation, image retrieval) that require very little or no labeled training data (zero-shot, one-shot, and transfer learning; or domain adaptation); and allow end-users to quickly customize machine learning models to novel problems (model selection, interactive learning, and workflow automation).





What You Need
Minimum Job Requirements:

· Research-level expertise in one or more of the above focus areas
· Demonstrated ability to publish research in top peer-reviewed journals or conference proceedings
· Strong programming skills

Desired Skills:
· Research-level expertise in two or more of the above focus areas
· Research experience in using topological graphs for image analysis
· Demonstrated ability to work in interdisciplinary project teams and learn about other fields
· Active Q clearance, or alternatively the ability to obtain a Q clearance

Education:
Ph.D. in computer science, computer vision, machine learning, imaging science, mathematics, electrical engineering, statistics, data science, or a closely related discipline completed within the past five years or to be completed soon prior to employment.

Notes to Applicants:
In addition to submitting a CV, applicants must include a cover letter describing their research interests.

Postdoctoral appointments are for two years, with the possibility of a third year extension.




Additional Details:

Position does not require a security clearance. Selected candidates will be subject to drug testing and other pre-employment background checks.
New-Employment Drug Test: The Laboratory requires successful applicants to complete a new-employment drug test and maintains a substance abuse policy that includes random drug testing.

Candidates may be considered for a Director's Postdoc Fellowship and outstanding candidates may be considered for the prestigious Richard P. Feynman, Darleane Christian Hoffman, J. Robert Oppenheimer, or Frederick Reines Distinguished Postdoc Fellowships .

About Us Presbyterian Healthcare Services is a locally owned, not-for-profit healthcare system of nine hospitals, a statewide health plan and a growing multi-specialty medical group. Founded in New Mexico in 1908, it is the state's largest private employer with approximately 11,000 employees.




Presbyterian's story is really the story of the remarkable people who have chosen to work here. Starting with Reverend Cooper who began our journey in 1908, the hard work of thousands of physicians, employees, board members, and other volunteers brought Presbyterian from a tiny tuberculosis sanatorium to a statewide healthcare system, serving more than 700,000 New Mexicans. We are part of New Mexico's history - and committed to its future. That is why we will continue to work just as hard and care just as deeply to serve New Mexico for years to come. About New Mexico New Mexico's unique blend of Spanish, Mexican and Native American influences contribute to a culturally rich lifestyle. Add in Albuquerque's International Balloon Fiesta, Los Alamos' nuclear scientists, Roswell's visitors from outer space, and Santa Fe's artists, and you get an eclectic mix of people, places and experiences that make this state great. Cities in New Mexico are continually ranked among the nation's best places to work and live by Forbes magazine, Kiplinger's Personal Finance, and other corporate and government relocation managers like Worldwide ERC. New Mexico offers endless recreational opportunities to explore, and enjoy an active lifestyle. Venture off the beaten path, challenge your body in the elements, or open yourself up to the expansive sky. From hiking, golfing and biking to skiing, snowboarding and boating, it's all available among our beautiful wonders of the west. AA/EOE/VET/DISABLED.
