Recently ranked #5 in Forbes Magazine's list of America's Most Promising Companies, Carvana offers the excitement, culture, and opportunity of a start-up, along with the capitalization and infrastructure of an established business.



We sell cars, but we're not salespeople. At Carvana, we've made it our mission to transform how cars are bought and sold. We saw a huge problem with how much it can suck to buy a car the traditional way so we committed to tackling one of the largest, yet-to-be-disrupted markets in the world – the $1T per year U.S. car market (yes, that's $Trillion with a ""T"").



We provide a seamless, online car buying experience for consumers. From our searchable showroom of fully-inspected, certified cars, to high-resolution 360° photographs of our vehicles' interior and exterior, to real-time financing and warranty packages. With delivery possible to the buyer's driveway in 24 hours or pick-up available from one of our state-of-the-art car vending machines (yes, you read that right) all with a 7-day money back guarantee, customer satisfaction is at the core of our business. With no dealerships or commissioned sales people, we also save thousands of dollars per car that we pass on to our customers.

With no dealerships or commissioned salespeople, we also save thousands of dollars per car in expenses that we pass on to our customers.

This position will support the adoption and expansion of the university’s Salesforce enterprise implementation for both undergraduate and graduate recruitment, marketing, and pre-enrollment processes.

The focus of this job centers around producing timely results that are high quality and accurate. Benefiting from an analytical, inquiring and critical mind, this job requires imagination and strong problem solving skills, but with a strong technical orientation.



The job requires an ability to deal with abstract concepts, systems and ideas and all of that in an organized and self-disciplined way.

This job demands deep knowledge and expertise and to do it successfully depends on understanding detailed information.



Intellectual confidence is important in this job and to do it well requires close, hands-on involvement and careful follow-up. Central to this job is the need to weigh all decisions carefully and thoroughly, based on expertise in order to avoid unpredictable risk.

The successful candidate will possess strong technical and practical problem-solving skills to deliver creative solutions in the course of demanding client engagements of many varieties.

Focused on creating impact and willing to bend/stretch to deliver an A+ outcome

Ability and willingness to think critically and solve “out-of-the-box” problems independently

About the Role
The successful candidate will onboard to the role by completing training on our internal processes, algorithms, programming tools, industry ecosystem, and client engagement structures.
After training is complete, this role will be heavily involved in projects that use statistical analysis to answer HR related questions asked by leading public and private companies, primarily Fortune 500 organizations. Examples include statistical pay equity studies to help clients test whether pay practices differ by gender or ethnicity, workforce analytics studying attrition patterns and drivers, and performance metrics that are correlated with future shareholder value creation.
Over time, this role can expand to encompass a broader portfolio of project types. For example, our HR analytics consulting practice works closely with our valuation practice such that a natural extension is to valuing complex compensation and other financial instruments using Monte Carlo simulation and other best-of-breed methods.

Lead the team to use proper statistical techniques by bringing excellent technical skills to complex problems. Serve as a technical subject matter expert and “go-to person” on the team.

Support implementation of new clients by understanding client-specific needs and expectations; support process creation, implementation timeline management, deliverable walk-throughs and more to arrive at exceptional client experiences.
Participate in practice- and firm-level initiatives involving client service, thought leadership, business development, channel relationships, and risk management.

Relocation: Relocation assistance is available for this position.







Work Authorization: UCAR/NCAR will sponsor a work visa to fill this position.
Where You Will Work:
NCAR’s Computational and Information Systems Laboratory (CISL) is a leader in supercomputing and data services necessary for the advancement of atmospheric and geospace science. CISL’s mission is to remain a leader at the forefront of ensuring that research universities, NCAR, and the larger geosciences community have access to the computational resources they need for their research. To fulfill the need for a stronger workforce at the intersection of High Performance Computing (HPC) and geoscience problems, CISL engages in education and outreach activities to inspire and attract a diverse future workforce.
What You Will Do:
The Machine Learning (ML) scientist will apply ML to the Earth system sciences as part of the Analytics and Integrative Machine Learning (AIML) Group in the Technology Development Division (TDD) in the Computational and Information Systems Laboratory (CISL) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The incumbent will have a proven ability to apply a variety of ML algorithmic approaches to problems in earth systems science or related physical science disciplines.
Relevant ML application experience may include the use of ML training and inference systems for the recognition, prediction or tracking of important features or events in datasets, or alternatively, through the auto-encoding of suitable physics parameterizations in earth system models with neural networks, the replacement of model components with efficient, learned emulators. Machine learning techniques may also be applied by the scientist to automate or accelerate the human data analysis of hundreds of routine data products, thus amplifying the scientific capability of researchers, the integration of non-traditional data sources into earth system prediction systems, to help optimize supercomputing workflows through ML-guided resource management, or for the early detection and steering of numerical simulations.

Responsibilities:
The position works on machine learning projects with scientists, engineers and students in NCAR’s Computational and Information Systems Laboratory (CISL), the Research Applications Laboratory (RAL), the Earth Observing Laboratory (EOL), the High Altitude Observatory (HAO), and the Atmospheric Chemistry, Observations and Modeling (ACOM) Laboratory, and potentially with external data scientists as well. The successful candidate will identify and apply appropriate machine learning techniques focused on two initial projects:
Emulating atmospheric organic chemistry reaction networks. Current chemistry-climate models cannot represent the complex chemistry involved in the degradation of hydrocarbons emitted by anthropogenic activities, due to the enormous number of species and reactions. ML emulation may produce less costly reduced models, providing new opportunities to investigate their impact on human health and air quality.
Data bottlenecks in cloud observational systems. Estimating the radiation balance in the Earth system is central to predictive climate models and hinges on understanding cloud processes. The Holographic Detector for Clouds (HOLODEC) is an airborne instrument that gives an unrivaled view of 3-D distributions of droplets, providing an unprecedented accuracy and detail of cloud physics data. However, analyzing the huge data volumes produced by the instrument with current techniques presents a bottleneck, limiting the instrument’s scientific utility. Image-based ML methods could accelerate the analysis process and help advance our understanding of cloud processes.
For each project, the scientist will work with the team, and in collaboration with domain scientists, to create and share the necessary training datasets, and apply, tune and evaluate and verify a variety of machine learning approaches to solving these problems. The machine learning scientist’s efforts will be built on top of NCAR’s core capability in domain-focused statistical development, and will leverage its vast observational and model output datasets, and CISL’s petascale supercomputing infrastructure, and cloud-based resources and environments. The position will require the ability to work in teams and across disciplines in order to cross-fertilize ideas and build strong collaborations to tackle Earth system science challenges. This integration with and support from colleagues in the earth system sciences will help to ensure the relevance and sustainability of the ML project scientist’s research activities.
The position provides high-level machine learning expertise to these projects, assists in planning the projects human and financial resource requirements, and will participate in the evaluation of the project’s progress, its results, and make adjustments to the project’s approach to better achieve objectives. The Machine Learning scientist may also serve, from time to time, as a consultant to internal staff and external organizations on machine learning topics.
Communication of Results: The scientist participates in mission-relevant academic activities including conferences, workshops and tutorials. Documents research results by authoring peer-reviewed conference and journal publications, and publicizes those results in presentations at scientific meetings. As a subject matter expert, helps develop grant proposal concepts, teams and text, and may be called upon to serve as a principal or co-principal investigator.
Community Service: The position responsibilities will also include an education, training and outreach component. An ML short course developed by the team has now been conducted at a number of venues. The scientist will we help support and further develop this material, as well as initiatives to increase the organization’s training capacity in data-centric science, including machine learning. The scientist serves as a reviewer on scientific papers and proposals, or on conference organizing committees.
What You Need:
Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities:
Ability to work both independently or collaboratively as a group lead to solve routine and/or occasionally complex technical problems. Ability to organize, prioritize and coordinate multiple tasks. Ability to conduct research with minimal supervision.
Excellent communication skills in presenting scientific research, and writing papers in scientific journals, technical reports and proposals. Ability to work and communicate with an international and multi-disciplinary team.
