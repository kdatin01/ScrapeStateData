Our mission in Cortex is to empower teams at Twitter to effectively practice Machine Learning (ML) within Twitter by providing both a platform and modeling expertise. If you’re interested in the platform side of this and get excited about reusable, powerful tools which increase developer efficiency, read on!

Our software in the Cortex Platform org allows ML practitioners to share features, automate workflows, train models using advanced techniques, and serve models quickly and with confidence in their operation.

Our team specifically is called Machine Learning Data and Observability, and we seek to provide visibility, awareness, and understanding of the ML lifecycle. Our efforts affect every other product in Cortex in an effort to make our users able to understand their data, data pipelines, and models.

Design and own projects and drive their delivery
Explore problems in partnership with our users to understand new technical domains
Craft pragmatic solutions using existing tools as well as writing our own
Help drive larger decisions within Cortex that connect with our core mission
Sample projects we’ve worked on

Ongoing collaboration with Twitter’s ML Ethics, Transparency, and Accountability team

Posted: Oct 30, 2019
Role Number: 200075041
Would you like to play a part in the next revolution in human- computer interaction? Create groundbreaking technology for large scale systems, spoken language, big data, and artificial intelligence? And work with the people who created the intelligent assistant that helps millions of people get things done — just by asking?
The vision for the Siri Data organization is to improve Siri by using data as the voice of our customers. As an Analytic Engineer on the team, you will design, implement the generation of, and analyze data that informs the development of new classes of AI/ML-driven Siri experiences.
Key Qualifications
You are a polyglot programmer who has experience with full-stack application development. Experience with iOS development (Swift, Objective C) is a plus.
You have designed and developed instrumentation of the user experience in complex software systems.
You have built robust analytic pipelines and have a keen eye for how to scale and how to automate (e.g. Kafka, Spark, Druid, Airflow).
You are a statistical thinker: you care about distributions
more than averages; you can find and investigate sources of variance; you ensure you can measure effect sizes from changes in the user experience.
You are self-motivated and curious with demonstrated creative and critical thinking capabilities and an innate drive to improve how things work.
You have a track record of working well with constraints, demonstrating creativity when they must be adhered to and demonstrating courage when they must be changed.
You have a high tolerance for ambiguity. You find a way through. You anticipate. You connect and synthesize.
You can influence decisions with excellent verbal and written communications skills.
Description
You will partner closely with Siri machine learning and engineering teams who are pushing the state of the art forward for intelligent assistants. Your work will enable them to build mental models of Siri engagement and also directly shape priorities on how Siri improves.
You will become an expert in Siri's architecture and sources of data to guide how the Siri experience is instrumented and measured.
You will build tools that enable easier, programmatic integration of insights across the Siri partner teams.
Education & Experience
We are looking for people with a track record in designing information, deriving insights, and building relationships to affect decisions. Join us, and impact hundreds of millions of customers across billions of their interactions with a personal, intelligent assistant who is available on iPhone, iPad, HomePod, Mac, Watch, CarPlay, and tv across more than 30 languages.
We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.
Additional Requirements
Recruit, hire and nurture people who are not only great technically but also demonstrate success in the highly collaborative, functional environment of innovation at Apple.
Lead a team while keeping them connected, collaborating, inspired; whereby they understand how their work ladders into the bigger picture, mission, and vision
Give crisp feedback to your team that balances opportunities for growth with vision to inspire.
Work in service of something larger without creating a service org. Your team can deliver what is needed but also redefine what is possible.
You are humble and lead by example.
You have compassion for your colleagues and the challenges they face. You partner to drive pragmatic progress, but can drive a controversial direction when needed.
You model detailed thinking and crisp communication.
Move up and down the ladder of abstraction and help your team do so as well. You can talk and design on technical matters but are always able to connect that work to the impact it is in service of."

About BP:
BP's BPX Energy business (formerly known as the Lower 48) operates across a vast US geography, from Texas north through the Rocky Mountains. The business manages a diverse portfolio which includes an extensive unconventional resource base of about 7.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent across 5.5 million gross acres in some of the largest and most well-known basins in the US. Headquartered in Denver (Colorado), BPX Energy employs about 1,700 people across six states, operates more than 9,600 producing wells and has 70,000 royalty owners. Our vision is to be the premier, high return, onshore exploration and production company that consistently increases asset value. Our Wyoming operations are anchored on the giant Wamsutter tight gas field in the south central part of the state. In the San Juan area of Colorado and New Mexico we produce from tight gas sands and operate the largest coal-bed methane field in the US. Our Mid-Continent operations cover the prolific Anadarko, and is home to the famed East Texas basin, along with the Woodford shale gas play and Arkoma basin. We also have non-operating interests in over 10,000 wells across the US with substantial positions in both the Eagle Ford and Fayetteville shale basins. In 2018, BP completed a $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP's world-class unconventional oil and gas assets in the Permian-Delaware basin in Texas, along with two premium positions in the Eagle Ford and Haynesville basins in Texas and Louisiana. These assets currently produce 190,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which about 45 percent are liquid hydrocarbons. The deal represents BP’s largest purchase since buying ARCO in 1999. It is a transformational acquisition for our BPX Energy business which gives the BPX Energy team access to some of the best acreage in some of the best basins in the onshore U.S."

Job Description
The Complex Systems Simulation and Optimization Group in the NREL Computational Science Center has an opening for a full-time postdoctoral researcher in artificial intelligence (AI) and stochastic optimization for energy systems, with special emphasis on deep reinforcement learning (RL) for AI control. We believe that AI-powered systems have the potential to transform our renewable energy future through advanced automation and control, and are looking for a dynamic researcher with a strong technical background to help pursue this goal.
Stochastic optimization and sequential decision problems arise in a variety of areas of renewable energy research including power system planning and management, wind farm optimization, battery management, building energy management, and transportation. At the same time, recent advances in AI (and deep RL in particular) suggest that complex decision making can be optimized via a combination of machine learning, modeling and simulation, often with clear advantages over traditional optimization-based methods. However, these ideas are only just starting to be applied to renewable energy systems and thus constitute a promising set of research directions.
The successful candidate will collaborate to develop, adapt, improve, and scale cutting edge AI methods to real-world projects in support of NREL and EERE mission and goals. In addition, the candidate will collaborate with NREL staff and researchers, other national labs, and universities on efforts to develop and apply AI at scale to real-world problems in renewable energy research, with specific emphasis on modernization of the nation’s grid, building, and transportation infrastructure and operation to support the 100% renewable energy scenario. In particular, the candidate will participate in a large interdisciplinary effort to establish the foundations of so-called “autonomous energy systems”, in which quasi-independent agents interact to seamlessly integrate and control large numbers of distributed energy resources.
Responsibilities include:
Collaborate with NREL and partner researchers to develop and apply modern AI and stochastic control techniques for use in real-world energy systems. Primary challenges include identification of appropriate application areas, adaptation of methods to these areas, and scaling of methods to solve relevant problems. Key areas of study include the optimal incorporation of existing domain knowledge into AI methods, the development of scalable algorithms for continuous and/or mixed spaces, and development of hybrid methods that combine the best of both AI and classical stochastic optimization.
Evaluate and track the state of artificial intelligence and stochastic control research, especially for sequential decision problems in complex real-world spaces.
Author, present and assist in the preparation of technical papers, reports and conference proceedings on topics related to modern AI control methods and their application to energy systems.
.
Basic Qualifications
Must be a recent PhD graduate within the last three years.
.
Additional Qualifications
Preferred Qualifications
Expertise in deep reinforcement learning, including fundamental knowledge and core mathematical underpinnings of neural networks, deep understanding of Markov Decision Processes, state-of-the-art learning algorithms, and their application to continuous and/or large state-action spaces.
Expertise in stochastic optimal control, including optimization and control with and without uncertainty, dynamic programming, classical control theory, (stochastic) model predictive control, Kalman filters, scenario generation, etc.
Experience with game theory, complex systems theory, agent-based learning, and distributed optimization.
Strong background in mathematics, statistics, and probability.
Strong background in physics and engineering, esp. of power systems, grid-integrated buildings, and/or transportation systems.
Strong programming skills, especially experience using deep learning frameworks (e.g. TensorFlow) on high-performance computing/GPU platforms.
.
Submission Guidelines
Please note that in order to be considered an applicant for any position at NREL you must submit an application form for each position for which you believe you are qualified. Applications are not kept on file for future positions. Please include a cover letter and resume with each position application.
.
EEO Policy
NREL is dedicated to the principles of equal employment opportunity. NREL promotes a work environment that does not discriminate against workers or job applicants and prohibits unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, age, marital status, ancestry, actual or perceived sexual orientation, or veteran status, including special disabled veterans.

About BP:
BP's BPX Energy business (formerly known as the Lower 48) operates across a vast US geography, from Texas north through the Rocky Mountains. The business manages a diverse portfolio which includes an extensive unconventional resource base of about 7.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent across 5.5 million gross acres in some of the largest and most well-known basins in the US. Headquartered in Denver (Colorado), BPX Energy employs about 1,700 people across six states, operates more than 9,600 producing wells and has 70,000 royalty owners. Our vision is to be the premier, high return, onshore exploration and production company that consistently increases asset value. Our Wyoming operations are anchored on the giant Wamsutter tight gas field in the south central part of the state. In the San Juan area of Colorado and New Mexico we produce from tight gas sands and operate the largest coal-bed methane field in the US. Our Mid-Continent operations cover the prolific Anadarko, and is home to the famed East Texas basin, along with the Woodford shale gas play and Arkoma basin. We also have non-operating interests in over 10,000 wells across the US with substantial positions in both the Eagle Ford and Fayetteville shale basins. In 2018, BP completed a $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP's world-class unconventional oil and gas assets in the Permian-Delaware basin in Texas, along with two premium positions in the Eagle Ford and Haynesville basins in Texas and Louisiana. These assets currently produce 190,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which about 45 percent are liquid hydrocarbons. The deal represents BP’s largest purchase since buying ARCO in 1999. It is a transformational acquisition for our BPX Energy business which gives the BPX Energy team access to some of the best acreage in some of the best basins in the onshore U.S."

About BP:
BP's BPX Energy business (formerly known as the Lower 48) operates across a vast US geography, from Texas north through the Rocky Mountains. The business manages a diverse portfolio which includes an extensive unconventional resource base of about 7.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent across 5.5 million gross acres in some of the largest and most well-known basins in the US. Headquartered in Denver (Colorado), BPX Energy employs about 1,700 people across six states, operates more than 9,600 producing wells and has 70,000 royalty owners. Our vision is to be the premier, high return, onshore exploration and production company that consistently increases asset value. Our Wyoming operations are anchored on the giant Wamsutter tight gas field in the south central part of the state. In the San Juan area of Colorado and New Mexico we produce from tight gas sands and operate the largest coal-bed methane field in the US. Our Mid-Continent operations cover the prolific Anadarko, and is home to the famed East Texas basin, along with the Woodford shale gas play and Arkoma basin. We also have non-operating interests in over 10,000 wells across the US with substantial positions in both the Eagle Ford and Fayetteville shale basins. In 2018, BP completed a $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP's world-class unconventional oil and gas assets in the Permian-Delaware basin in Texas, along with two premium positions in the Eagle Ford and Haynesville basins in Texas and Louisiana. These assets currently produce 190,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which about 45 percent are liquid hydrocarbons. The deal represents BP’s largest purchase since buying ARCO in 1999. It is a transformational acquisition for our BPX Energy business which gives the BPX Energy team access to some of the best acreage in some of the best basins in the onshore U.S."

About BP:
BP's BPX Energy business (formerly known as the Lower 48) operates across a vast US geography, from Texas north through the Rocky Mountains. The business manages a diverse portfolio which includes an extensive unconventional resource base of about 7.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent across 5.5 million gross acres in some of the largest and most well-known basins in the US. Headquartered in Denver (Colorado), BPX Energy employs about 1,700 people across six states, operates more than 9,600 producing wells and has 70,000 royalty owners. Our vision is to be the premier, high return, onshore exploration and production company that consistently increases asset value. Our Wyoming operations are anchored on the giant Wamsutter tight gas field in the south central part of the state. In the San Juan area of Colorado and New Mexico we produce from tight gas sands and operate the largest coal-bed methane field in the US. Our Mid-Continent operations cover the prolific Anadarko, and is home to the famed East Texas basin, along with the Woodford shale gas play and Arkoma basin. We also have non-operating interests in over 10,000 wells across the US with substantial positions in both the Eagle Ford and Fayetteville shale basins. In 2018, BP completed a $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP's world-class unconventional oil and gas assets in the Permian-Delaware basin in Texas, along with two premium positions in the Eagle Ford and Haynesville basins in Texas and Louisiana. These assets currently produce 190,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which about 45 percent are liquid hydrocarbons. The deal represents BP’s largest purchase since buying ARCO in 1999. It is a transformational acquisition for our BPX Energy business which gives the BPX Energy team access to some of the best acreage in some of the best basins in the onshore U.S."

You have passion for excellence. The wrong choice of data could cost the business dearly. You maintain rigorous standards and take ownership of the outcome of your data pipelines.



You do whatever it takes to add value. You don’t care whether you’re building complex ML models, writing blazing fast code, integrating multiple disparate data-sets, or creating baseline models - you care passionately about shareholders and know that as a curator of data insight you can unlock massive cost savings.



You have a limitless curiosity. You constantly ask questions about the technologies and approaches we are taking and are constantly learning about industry best practices you can bring to our team.

You have excellent business and communication skills to be able to work with product owners to understand key business questions and earn the trust of senior leaders. You will need to learn Data Center architecture and components of electrical engineering to build your models.

For these positions, they are asking for us to provide data analysts that are passionate about transforming and making data usable for new services, business models, and to help economic development. We are looking for people that believe data is the new gold.
We are looking for data analysts, data wranglers, data scientists with excellent leadership, technical, and subject matter expertise qualities. We have projects lining up developing research-grade science data algorithms from in-situ sensors to bringing together data sources from disparate sub-agencies into enterprise platforms to make available on open-data platforms. We have projects that are creating data and bigdata prototypes whether it be on CartoDB geospatial, D3 Sankeys and various libraries, feeding and harvesting RDF Triplets into catalogs, or integrating into SEO environments. Admittedly, we have some less sexy data wrangling and janitor tasks that will require more ETL skills to hone in on.
To boot, we want our analysts to be natural change agents and passionate about change while empathetic to the clients environment on how they leverage, mature, and incorporate data products, services, and new capabilities. We want leaders who can both support the influence of the right change direction while managing the technical and business analysis and design, and are skilled and self-motivated with solid domain/subject matter expertise.
Our analysts will be on teams that, through facilitated analysis, work shoulder-to-shoulder with teammates to come up with the conceptual and logical design and architecture. Analysts will also be working very closely with client staff or system integrators to rapidly implement changes or agile release. Furthermore, we devise and craft strategies and communications solutions to broadcast and brag about their change efforts and results. This is what we do – we bring transformations to life.
Position Requirements:

You will be expected to rapidly ramp-up on client lingo, proactively make observations of patterns, anomalies, problems, and be customer service focused. You will be expected to be highly self-motivated and understand you will be held accountable to commitments. We look for decisive individuals able to rapidly respond to change requests and able to communicate, track, and escalate risk. We expect you to be proactive, efficient, and ready to learn quickly in response to all client and team member needs. This is a bootcamp-type position setup for growth.
We want you to not only gain technical skills, but also grow your interactive and client facing skills. All roles will require strong communication and interactive skills - oral, written, visual especially for triaging conflict, ideation barriers, mitigating risk, foster thought diversity and team environment. We expect all our roles to have a mastery of their technical level at their role whether that be in architectural methods, languages, work products, consulting techniques, and client culture. If they are not, they need to demonstrate how they are VERY fast learners.
For the technical prowess, we will want you to demonstrate your data science nerd-dom and technology stack as part of normal vernacular in one or many of these stacks (well, technologies in these stacks depending on the project). Of course, by no means do we expect all of the technologies, but prowess in one of the stacks:
Data Transformation – ETL, perl, python, SQL, FTP, Informatica, SAFE/FME, Kettle, GeoKettle
- Machine Learning - Markov or Markov Chain, Naive Bayes, N-Grams, Levenshtein distance or Damerau-Levenshtein distance, Fuzzy Search, NLP,
Algorithm Development and Visualization – R, Octave, MatLAB, OpenCV, Viola-Jones Haar-Cascade
Geospatial Transformation – GEOJson, CartoDB, K-Means, Nearest Neighbor, Anselin Local Moran's, Monte Carlo Simulation, Mantel Index, Standard Deviational Ellipse, GeoServer, ESRI, ESRI/Hadoop, PostGIS
Web BI – NodeJS, PHP, Web JavaScript libs like jQuery, ExtJS, D3JS, R Project, HTML5, CSS3, Many more.
NoSQL – MongDB, Hadoop, CouchDB, Solr, ElasticSearch
From a skillset of functions, our data science analysts would need to have a strong focus in one or more of these core areas:
- Open Data User Experience - Someone who has gathered public data and used it in a project (and/or application), is aware that there is an industry wide 'current debate' about open data, and has filed a CORA/FOIA request to gather data.
- Analysis - Someone who can 'read' a dataset and 'tell its story' - top points for ""food desert analysis"", ""restaurant inspections analysis"", ""bike trails routing analysis"" - or any other specific ""human geography"" and/or ""land use"" analysis. Ideally this person can use tools like GIS/RS, Tableau, Carto, D3, JavaScript, Python, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator.
- Manual Data Entry - Has an eye for detail and has patience to meticulously check and double check others' data entry, and a desire to work with metadata. Can work in Excel and Google Sheets.
- Data Wrangling - Can manipulate and verify transformations on data, also has general knowledge of coding languages, can read/edit JavaScript, SQL, Python, Ogr2Ogr, GDAL.
- Database Administration - Has a basic familiarity with relational database and geodatabase structures, organizing and maintaining data, metadata.
Finally, our data science analysts will need to meet the following:
1 year of consulting experience – higher compensation for additional 3 more years in related analytical work products and additional 2 more years in subject matter
Could pass ad-hoc technical and whiteboard test given various data ETL and other patterns of real-time, large data, data cleanup, etc. scenarios
For public sector work, our work is traditionally unclassified, but will require certain amount of background, reference, and other checks
Travel will be maximum 20%
We emphasize a balance of work and life and target 40-50 hour weeks with ample times to refresh with great paid-time off.
We do NOT currently have an opening.:
We review our requirements quarterly and this could change. We like to plan ahead in finding amazing talent.:

It is responsible for convening stakeholders to plan evaluations, discuss interim progress, share key findings, and discuss potential implications of the findings on program operations and future evaluation needs. This position collaborates with multiple internal and external partners to negotiate evaluation timelines, methods, and deliverables, and document the agreements in written scopes of works. The position deploys a high level of knowledge and expertise in evaluation theories, frameworks, tools, and research methods, as well as expertise in the full gamut of descriptive and inferential statistical analysis techniques available to answer various evaluation and data questions.

About BP:
BP's BPX Energy business (formerly known as the Lower 48) operates across a vast US geography, from Texas north through the Rocky Mountains. The business manages a diverse portfolio which includes an extensive unconventional resource base of about 7.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent across 5.5 million gross acres in some of the largest and most well-known basins in the US. Headquartered in Denver (Colorado), BPX Energy employs about 1,700 people across six states, operates more than 9,600 producing wells and has 70,000 royalty owners. Our vision is to be the premier, high return, onshore exploration and production company that consistently increases asset value. Our Wyoming operations are anchored on the giant Wamsutter tight gas field in the south central part of the state. In the San Juan area of Colorado and New Mexico we produce from tight gas sands and operate the largest coal-bed methane field in the US. Our Mid-Continent operations cover the prolific Anadarko, and is home to the famed East Texas basin, along with the Woodford shale gas play and Arkoma basin. We also have non-operating interests in over 10,000 wells across the US with substantial positions in both the Eagle Ford and Fayetteville shale basins. In 2018, BP completed a $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP's world-class unconventional oil and gas assets in the Permian-Delaware basin in Texas, along with two premium positions in the Eagle Ford and Haynesville basins in Texas and Louisiana. These assets currently produce 190,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which about 45 percent are liquid hydrocarbons. The deal represents BP’s largest purchase since buying ARCO in 1999. It is a transformational acquisition for our BPX Energy business which gives the BPX Energy team access to some of the best acreage in some of the best basins in the onshore U.S."

About BP:
BP's BPX Energy business (formerly known as the Lower 48) operates across a vast US geography, from Texas north through the Rocky Mountains. The business manages a diverse portfolio which includes an extensive unconventional resource base of about 7.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent across 5.5 million gross acres in some of the largest and most well-known basins in the US. Headquartered in Denver (Colorado), BPX Energy employs about 1,700 people across six states, operates more than 9,600 producing wells and has 70,000 royalty owners. Our vision is to be the premier, high return, onshore exploration and production company that consistently increases asset value. Our Wyoming operations are anchored on the giant Wamsutter tight gas field in the south central part of the state. In the San Juan area of Colorado and New Mexico we produce from tight gas sands and operate the largest coal-bed methane field in the US. Our Mid-Continent operations cover the prolific Anadarko, and is home to the famed East Texas basin, along with the Woodford shale gas play and Arkoma basin. We also have non-operating interests in over 10,000 wells across the US with substantial positions in both the Eagle Ford and Fayetteville shale basins. In 2018, BP completed a $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP's world-class unconventional oil and gas assets in the Permian-Delaware basin in Texas, along with two premium positions in the Eagle Ford and Haynesville basins in Texas and Louisiana.

Relocation: No relocation package is offered for this position.




Work Authorization: U.S. Citizenship, Permanent Residency, or other protected status under 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3) is required for this position. UCAR/NCAR will not sponsor a work visa (e.g., J-1, H1-B, etc.) for this position.
Where You Will Work:
Located in Boulder, Colorado, the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) is one of the world’s premier scientific institutions, with an internationally recognized staff and research program dedicated to advancing knowledge, providing community-based resources, and building human capacity in the atmospheric and related sciences. NCAR is sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and managed by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR).
What You Will Do:
The Analytics and Integrative Machine Learning Group (AIML) is part of the Technology Development Division (TDD) in the Computational and Information Systems Laboratory (CISL) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The AIML Group is investigating the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and data science techniques to advance Earth System science across a broad front of application areas.
The team is currently engaged in several exciting on-going projects, including: improving weather and climate models by emulating atmospheric processes with observations and model data; predicting the impacts of coronal mass ejections on Earth’s geospace environment; and using GOES-16 satellite observations to better predict and understand severe weather. Projects for 2020 include:
Emulating atmospheric organic chemistry reaction networks. Current chemistry-climate models cannot represent the complex chemistry involved in the degradation of hydrocarbons emitted by anthropogenic activities, due to the enormous number of species and reactions. ML emulation may produce less costly reduced models, providing new opportunities to investigate their impact on human health and air quality.
Data bottlenecks in cloud observational systems. Estimating the radiation balance in the Earth system is central to predictive climate models and hinges on understanding cloud processes. The Holographic Detector for Clouds (HOLODEC) is an airborne instrument that gives an unrivaled view of 3-D distributions of droplets, providing an unprecedented accuracy and detail of cloud physics data. However, analyzing the huge data volumes produced by the instrument with current techniques presents a bottleneck, limiting the instrument’s scientific utility. Image-based ML methods could accelerate the analysis process and help advance our understanding of cloud processes.
For these projects, the student assistant with a background in machine learning (ML) will apply ML algorithms to these exciting problems under the supervision of the AIML staff. This task will involve some portion of the following tasks: extensive experimentation with multiple ML algorithms (random forests, convolutional neural networks, etc.) using mainstream frameworks; optimizing input variable and training, validation, and testing data set selection, evaluating algorithmic hyperparameters and learning rates; measuring algorithm performance, input sensitivities, and interpretability of the results.
Project workload will be adjusted and assigned taking into account the student’s interests, skills and abilities.

Responsibilities:
Use common ML frameworks to train different algorithms to assigned problems and projects.
Optimize ML algorithms: select input variables and training, validation, and testing data sets; evaluate algorithmic hyperparameters and learning rates, and loss functions; compare different algorithm types.
Measure algorithm performance, input sensitivities, and interpretability of the trained algorithms.

What You Need:
Education and Years of Experience:
Currently enrolled in a College, University, or Professional School.
Working on Computer Science, Geoscience, Data Science, Statistics or equivalent degree.
Machine Learning background is required (coursework is acceptable).
Experience in atmospheric or related sciences is a plus.
Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities:
Python programming experience; scientific Python experience (numpy, pandas, xarray) desired
Familiarity with ML libraries like Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit-learn
Familiarity with running and editing Jupyter notebooks
Basic knowledge of the theory and practice of machine learning
Familiarity with at least one version control system (e.g. Git)
Excellent interpersonal skills required for fostering good collaborative relationships.
Ability to work with a diverse group of peers.
Skill in organizing and prioritizing assignments.
Excellent oral and written communication skills including clear procedure and documentation abilities.
Ability to assist in the training of others.
Ability to perform occasional/infrequent travel, if required.
May represent the group to internal/external organization in explaining complex technical ideas and issues.
Ability and willingness to work within guidelines and policies of organization and assigned work groups.

The world needs more DarkOwls, and fewer bad guys. We are experiencing a time of great growth and are expanding our Research Development team to generate algorithms, analytic tools, and publications that provide unprecedented capability and insights for our analysts and clients. The right person is a pro-active: rolling up their sleeves, jumping in, and making sense of our data so we can stay on the leading edge of darknet analysis.
The cool part is the tools, algorithms, and prototypes that you design provide the analytic foundation for company’s products. Creativity and dedication are a must, so are skills and a sense of humor.
This is a full-time position based in our downtown Denver office or remote for the right candidate.


What a day in the life of a Data Scientist looks like:

Priorities change, and we need to pivot on a dime)
Additionally, you provide guidance and mentoring to more junior personnel as needed. We are always trying to bring up new folks, and value wise people who can help them along.
Work cross-functionally: you need to work with folks across engineering and product teams to understand system requirements, define technical tasks, and execute the tasks. If you are a person who likes to work by yourself in a cubicle and not interact with other human beings then this job is not for you, sorry.


What you bring to the table:
You need the equivalent of 10 or more years of relevant research experience manipulating and analyzing large, complex, and diverse data sets.
You have a strong background and experience in several of the following:
Machine Learning
Modeling and Simulation
Big Data
Predictive Analytics
Optimization
Darknet (Bonus points for this)
Software prototyping and engineering
Algorithm Development
Experimentation design and execution
Development of compelling publications for internal and external audiences
You can operate relatively independently, but also be a team player and understand how to work with remote co-workers. We strive to be a no-drama company.
Analytical, intellectually curious, excellent problem-solving skills who is comfortable dealing with raw and unstructured and translating it into forward thinking recommendations
Strong written and oral communication skills.
Desire to learn, grow, and evolve within a fast-paced, dynamic environment.

About BP:
BP's BPX Energy business (formerly known as the Lower 48) operates across a vast US geography, from Texas north through the Rocky Mountains. The business manages a diverse portfolio which includes an extensive unconventional resource base of about 7.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent across 5.5 million gross acres in some of the largest and most well-known basins in the US. Headquartered in Denver (Colorado), BPX Energy employs about 1,700 people across six states, operates more than 9,600 producing wells and has 70,000 royalty owners. Our vision is to be the premier, high return, onshore exploration and production company that consistently increases asset value. Our Wyoming operations are anchored on the giant Wamsutter tight gas field in the south central part of the state. In the San Juan area of Colorado and New Mexico we produce from tight gas sands and operate the largest coal-bed methane field in the US. Our Mid-Continent operations cover the prolific Anadarko, and is home to the famed East Texas basin, along with the Woodford shale gas play and Arkoma basin. We also have non-operating interests in over 10,000 wells across the US with substantial positions in both the Eagle Ford and Fayetteville shale basins. In 2018, BP completed a $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP's world-class unconventional oil and gas assets in the Permian-Delaware basin in Texas, along with two premium positions in the Eagle Ford and Haynesville basins in Texas and Louisiana. These assets currently produce 190,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which about 45 percent are liquid hydrocarbons. The deal represents BP’s largest purchase since buying ARCO in 1999. It is a transformational acquisition for our BPX Energy business which gives the BPX Energy team access to some of the best acreage in some of the best basins in the onshore U.S."

About BP:
BP's BPX Energy business (formerly known as the Lower 48) operates across a vast US geography, from Texas north through the Rocky Mountains. The business manages a diverse portfolio which includes an extensive unconventional resource base of about 7.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent across 5.5 million gross acres in some of the largest and most well-known basins in the US. Headquartered in Denver (Colorado), BPX Energy employs about 1,700 people across six states, operates more than 9,600 producing wells and has 70,000 royalty owners. Our vision is to be the premier, high return, onshore exploration and production company that consistently increases asset value. Our Wyoming operations are anchored on the giant Wamsutter tight gas field in the south central part of the state. In the San Juan area of Colorado and New Mexico we produce from tight gas sands and operate the largest coal-bed methane field in the US. Our Mid-Continent operations cover the prolific Anadarko, and is home to the famed East Texas basin, along with the Woodford shale gas play and Arkoma basin. We also have non-operating interests in over 10,000 wells across the US with substantial positions in both the Eagle Ford and Fayetteville shale basins. In 2018, BP completed a $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP's world-class unconventional oil and gas assets in the Permian-Delaware basin in Texas, along with two premium positions in the Eagle Ford and Haynesville basins in Texas and Louisiana. These assets currently produce 190,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which about 45 percent are liquid hydrocarbons. The deal represents BP’s largest purchase since buying ARCO in 1999. It is a transformational acquisition for our BPX Energy business which gives the BPX Energy team access to some of the best acreage in some of the best basins in the onshore U.S."

About BP:
BP's BPX Energy business (formerly known as the Lower 48) operates across a vast US geography, from Texas north through the Rocky Mountains. The business manages a diverse portfolio which includes an extensive unconventional resource base of about 7.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent across 5.5 million gross acres in some of the largest and most well-known basins in the US. Headquartered in Denver (Colorado), BPX Energy employs about 1,700 people across six states, operates more than 9,600 producing wells and has 70,000 royalty owners. Our vision is to be the premier, high return, onshore exploration and production company that consistently increases asset value. Our Wyoming operations are anchored on the giant Wamsutter tight gas field in the south central part of the state. In the San Juan area of Colorado and New Mexico we produce from tight gas sands and operate the largest coal-bed methane field in the US. Our Mid-Continent operations cover the prolific Anadarko, and is home to the famed East Texas basin, along with the Woodford shale gas play and Arkoma basin. We also have non-operating interests in over 10,000 wells across the US with substantial positions in both the Eagle Ford and Fayetteville shale basins. In 2018, BP completed a $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP's world-class unconventional oil and gas assets in the Permian-Delaware basin in Texas, along with two premium positions in the Eagle Ford and Haynesville basins in Texas and Louisiana. These assets currently produce 190,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which about 45 percent are liquid hydrocarbons. The deal represents BP’s largest purchase since buying ARCO in 1999. It is a transformational acquisition for our BPX Energy business which gives the BPX Energy team access to some of the best acreage in some of the best basins in the onshore U.S."
