2+ years’ professional experience with programmatic data analysis and visualization using R/Python and common packages (tidyverse, ggplot2, data.table, NumPy, Pandas); must be adept at writing your own functions and using common programming idioms for analyzing data
Experience working with real-world datasets, including database queries, data aggregation, record linkage, data cleaning/reshaping/management, and descriptive data analysis; data visualization and automated reporting experience preferred
Excellent attention to detail, critical thinking skills, and a systematic and creative approach to problem-solving, with strong data intuition
Ability to work well with a team and on a deadline
Self-motivated to develop and learn new skills
Desired Skills and Experience:
Formal training in research design (experimental and non-experimental) and statistical testing, including classical significance tests, linear models, survival analysis, and timeseries
Experience with digital analytics (such as Google Analytics or Adobe Analytics) and e-commerce/marketing fundamentals
