DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES

Chair (Tenured Full Professor)



The University of Delaware invites applications and nominations for the Chair of the Department of Mathematical Sciences. The Department seeks a Chair enthusiastic about advancing its prominence, furthering its established scholarly impact, and leading efforts to innovate in and excel at its extensive teaching role at the University. The expected start date is August 1, 2020. The Chair is appointed for a renewable five-year term.



The Department of Mathematical Sciences is in the College of Arts and Sciences and has 45 full-time faculty, 350 majors and 180 minors at the undergraduate level, and 60 graduate students. The Department offers eight majors, all with honors versions, as well as M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. Five-year combined Bachelor and M.S. options are also available. The Department plays a leading role in the interdisciplinary M.S. in Data Science, contributing courses and a five-year option to combine with any of its undergraduate degrees. The scholarship of the faculty covers a wide swath of mathematics and its applications including algebra, functional and harmonic analysis, information and coding theory, ordinary and partial differential equations, graph theory, mathematics education, numerical analysis, probability, and algebraic topology. Application areas include biology, data science, fluid dynamics, materials science, medicine, networks, scientific computing, and quantum information science.



The next Chair will have an exceptional opportunity, in collaboration with the faculty and a forward-looking College and University administration, to further strengthen the research profile of the Department. The Chair’s leadership will be key to positioning the Department more prominently in many fields of the Mathematical Sciences. The Chair’s responsibilities include fiscal and other administrative operations of the Department, working with the faculty on academic policy and program development, and overall leadership in faculty development and student success. The Department enjoys excellent relations with its alumni and strong ties to the community through outreach activities, and the Chair represents the Department both internally and externally. The new Chair will be expected to maintain excellence in research and scholarship with full departmental support to assist with administrative responsibilities.



Candidates should have a strong record of scholarship and extensive teaching and professional service; demonstrated evidence of academic leadership at the department, college, or university level; experience with graduate studies; and a well-developed commitment to diversity. The ideal candidate will have a broad vision for the Department, a desire to foster a collegial and mutually respectful culture within the Department, a commitment to promoting interdisciplinary links with other departments and programs at UD, an interest in expanding opportunities leading to external funding (e.g., grants, gifts, and fellowships), and a commitment to developing curricular, student, and faculty diversity.
