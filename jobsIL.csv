COMPANY



LendingTree is the nation's largest online lending marketplace. That means we connect customers with multiple lenders so they find the best deals on loans, credit cards, savings accounts and insurance. Our goal is to help people save money, and we believe the best way to do that is by giving them a way to shop for loans and compare lenders so they make their best financial choices.



Our CEO Doug Lebda founded the company in 1996 after a frustrating house-hunting experience. In those days, we mostly helped people find good mortgage deals. Now, we help consumers find their best in personal loans, auto loans, business loans, student loans, credit cards, savings accounts, home equity loans and more.



What else you should know:


We're a publicly-traded company (TREE).
We've welcomed several other companies into the LendingTree family to augment our efforts at helping borrowers make their most sensible financial choices.
We've built the LendingTree app and My LendingTree dashboard to give consumers tools to manage and monitor their financial health.
We still make funny commercials ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX43xCZV5j0 ).

CULTURE



We're a fast-paced company with an entrepreneurial bend. We work hard and test our products often. We're collaborative, ambitious, candid and high-energy. Our teammates are some of the brightest, most talented people you'll ever work with. We care more about your smarts than we do about the kinds of clothes you wear (but please, do wear clothes to work!), and we're pretty good about rewarding innovation, creativity and the knack for just getting stuff done (we even have an award for employees called the GSD, ""Get Stuff Done"").



Come work with us!

LendingTree is the kind of company that not only promotes diversity and inclusion; we thrive because of these values. We do not discriminate based on race, color, religion (or creed), gender, gender expression, age, national origin, disability, marital status, sexual orientation or military status."

Job Description
Risk analytics spans a broad set of empirically-based disciplines (applied statistics, econometrics, applied mathematics, algorithmics / optimization, and machine learning / data science) applied to and across all the major risk silos (credit, market, operational, liquidity, and model risk). We are seeking experts in these fields to apply their training and experience to optimize risk-and-return business decisions in the Performance and Analytics team within Allstate’s Enterprise Risk and Return Management group. We place a premium on expert statistical and econometric programming skills/experience with real-world data (e.g. SAS, Matlab, Python, SPSS, R, C++). A deep understanding of the value/necessity of independent replication and model validation is key, as is the knowledge of multiplicity/FDR issues and the ability and expertise to avoid overfitting. We highly value a very strong curiosity factor in exploring / understanding datasets containing covariates with complex relationships, appropriately tempered by the need for provable rigor and scientifically defensible and replicable methods based on modular, transparent, and well-documented code. This is consistent with the value we place on non-siloed, cross-disciplinary solutions to complex, real-world, non-textbook business challenges. The Risk Analytics Data Scientist is responsible for aligning with and contributing to corporate objectives by identifying and developing growth and profitability opportunities that will enable Allstate to generate profitable market share growth. He/she is accountable for using data and non-trivial statistical/econometric code that in most circumstances, seamlessly and directly translates into material business decisions for the firm. This includes building predictive models and developing original-yet-defensible methods that enable Allstate to make better decisions and win in the marketplace.


This role is responsible for leading the use of data to make risk-and-return analytics decisions. This includes the development and management of predictive modeling and the design and development and vetting of original methodology; statistical/econometric empirically-based coding expertise in at least one major relevant language is required (e.g. SAS, Matlab, Python, SPSS, R, C++) as this will serve as the basis by which the abovementioned business decisions are made. This role will manage complex projects and require some mentoring as it will have direct reports.
Key Responsibilities

Uses best practices to implement and develop complex statistical, econometric, and machine learning techniques to build risk analytics models that directly address material business needs.
Incorporates independent replication and model validation methods into the model development process and understands the necessity for this, as well as the extreme efficiency gains that result from this best practice.
The ability to boil down, without dumbing down, is critical: communicates effectively to team members, leadership and stakeholders on findings to ensure models are well understood and incorporated into business processes. Provides stakeholders the opportunity to influence the direction of the work via feedback loops.
Knowledge of, and experience dealing with multiplicity/FDR issues, and the ability and expertise to avoid overfitting, is key.
Develop and execute non-siloed, cross-disciplinary solutions to complex, non-textbook business challenges.
Works on data and complex business problems to drive improved risk-and-return business decisions and results by designing, building, and partnering to implement the right models for the right problems (e.g. Hadoop is not necessary (or desirable) for mere gigabytes of data, and random forests is not necessary (or desirable) when OLS conditions are sufficiently met).
Can identify new areas of data, research and methodology/models that can solve relevant risk-and-return business challenges.
Collaborates the with team to understand the business’ problems to identify the optimal methodological, and modeling (method+language/platform), approaches.
Mentors and develops junior data scientists
Job Qualifications
Master’s or PhD degree or concentration in a quantitative field such as statistics, econometrics/economics, data science, applied mathematics, computer science, and/or finance.
Peer reviewed publications & related awards are highly valued / desired, as are technical conference decks.
Academic honors, top standardized test scores, scholarships and fellowships are highly valued / desired.
Serving as referee / reviewer / editor of academic and industry journals is highly valued / desired.
Best-of-breed expertise in working with statistical software such as SAS, MatLab, Python, SPSS, R, C++.
Demonstrated expertise using statistical and econometric modeling and/or machine learning techniques to build models of nontrivial size and complexity that have driven company decision making.
Demonstrated experience incorporating independent replication and model validation methods into the model development process.
Demonstrated ability to boil down, without dumbing down, is key. Experience effectively communicating technical approaches and results to team members, leadership and stakeholders to ensure models are well understood and incorporated into business processes is critical.
Demonstrated knowledge of, and preferably practical experience dealing with, multiplicity/FDR issues and demonstrated ability and expertise in avoiding overfitting.
Demonstrated experience and ability developing and executing non-siloed, cross-disciplinary solutions to complex, real-world, non-textbook business challenges.
Knowledge of advanced modeling techniques, and the experience to know how to select, apply, and test the right models for the right problems.
Demonstrated ability and experience to provide both written and oral interpretation of highly specialized terms and data, and to present to others with varying levels of expertise to achieve ‘buy-in’ to the right approaches.
The candidate(s) offered this position will be required to submit to a background investigation, which includes a drug screen.

About CloudQuant
The explosion of alternative data, machine learning and big data technology have spawned a revolution in systematic and fundamental investing.

COMPANY

LendingTree is the nation’s largest online lending marketplace. That means we connect customers with multiple lenders so they find the best deals on loans, credit cards, savings accounts and insurance. Our goal is to help people save money, and we believe the best way to do that is by giving them a way to shop for loans and compare lenders so they make their best financial choices.

Our CEO Doug Lebda founded the company in 1996 after a frustrating house-hunting experience. In those days, we mostly helped people find good mortgage deals. Now, we help consumers find their best in personal loans, auto loans, business loans, student loans, credit cards, savings accounts, home equity loans and more.

What else you should know:
We’re a publicly-traded company (TREE).
We’ve welcomed several other companies into the LendingTree family to augment our efforts at helping borrowers make their most sensible financial choices.
We’ve built the LendingTree app and My LendingTree dashboard to give consumers tools to manage and monitor their financial health.
We still make funny commercials.
CULTURE

We’re a fast-paced company with an entrepreneurial bend. We work hard and test our products often. We’re collaborative, ambitious, candid and high-energy. Our teammates are some of the brightest, most talented people you’ll ever work with. We care more about your smarts than we do about the kinds of clothes you wear (but please, do wear clothes to work!), and we’re pretty good about rewarding innovation, creativity and the knack for just getting stuff done (we even have an award for employees called the GSD, “Get Stuff Done”).

Come work with us!
LendingTree is the kind of company that not only promotes diversity and inclusion; we thrive because of these values. We do not discriminate based on race, color, religion (or creed), gender, gender expression, age, national origin, disability, marital status, sexual orientation or military status."

The opportunity



Are you tired of spending all your time data cleaning or churning out standard reports? Or are you working on data science problems but worried that your solutions may never be productionized? Perhaps you've just been thinking that there must be a new and exciting way for you to apply your technical skills to make a big and positive impact. If you are keen to accelerate your career in data science and start working on unsolved, intellectually challenging business problems, then look no further.



FAQ



What will I be doing as a senior data scientist at Quantium?



Many things! Your role will likely change and grow as we continue to grow, and we wouldn't want you to feel pigeon-holed either. As a quick overview for now - you will be working in a team to develop end-to-end data science solutions for our clients, deploying complex models and decision-making engines into their everyday business processes. You will also bring your strong technical, commercial and client facing capabilities to play a leadership role with both clients and junior team members.



Can you tell me more about the current projects and client?

The current opportunity is working with a very large North American retailer with some of the biggest datasets in the industry. Our projects have included optimization of marketing and personalization, inventory forecasting, complex pricing, range / assortment and more.



What tools will I be using?



Keeping in mind that we always ensure the tools we are using are fit for purpose, for our current projects, we are typically using Spark / Scala or Teradata for data preparation and Spark / Scala, R and Python for advanced analytics.

When we are not working on tough, technical problems, you might find us winding down with a drink in hand in one of our coworking offices (currently based in Bentonville, San Francisco and Chicago).



You've mentioned consulting work. Tell me more about the travel requirements.



Our team is committed to growing trusted relationships with our clients, as such, you will be traveling for up to 80% of your time to work onsite at client offices with our current opportunity in Bentonville, Arkansas. And for those who want to make the most of the outdoor activities, growing arts scene and fresh cuisine that Bentonville has to offer, we can also provide support for relocation.



OK, this is all sounding great. But do you have a bullet point list so I can see if I meet the requirements of this opportunity?

The opportunity



Are you tired of spending all your time data cleaning or churning out standard reports? Or are you working on data science problems but worried that your solutions may never be productionized? Perhaps you've just been thinking that there must be a new and exciting way for you to apply your technical skills to make a big and positive impact. If you are keen to accelerate your career in data science and start working on unsolved, intellectually challenging business problems, then look no further.



FAQ



What will I be doing as a data scientist at Quantium?



Many, many things! Your role will likely change and grow as we continue to grow, and we wouldn't want you to feel pigeon-holed either. As a quick overview for now - you will be working in a team to develop end-to-end data science solutions for our clients, deploying complex models and decision-making engines into their everyday business processes. The current opportunity is working with a very large North American retailer with some of the biggest datasets in the industry. Our projects have included optimization of marketing and personalization, inventory forecasting, complex pricing, range / assortment and more.



What tools will I be using?



Keeping in mind that we always ensure the tools we are using are fit for purpose, for our current projects, we are typically using Spark / Scala or Teradata for data preparation and Spark / Scala, R and Python for advanced analytics.



Why should I be excited about this opportunity?

With our Americas team being established a little over two and a half years ago, this is a unique opportunity to join an exciting, high growth environment where each person can contribute in their own unique way and have a big impact on the success of the team, whilst knowing that you have global capability (proven products and solutions built over 17 years!) to back you.



What is the team culture like?

We are a team of diverse and fun data scientists, consultants and sales professionals working in an environment where colleagues quickly become friends. Working in small, cross-functional project teams, you will have lots of opportunity to learn from senior leaders and share your learning with the team too. When we are not working on tough, technical problems, you might find us winding down with a drink in hand in one of our coworking offices (currently based in Bentonville, San Francisco and Chicago).



You've mentioned consulting work. Tell me more about the travel requirements.



Our team is committed to growing trusted relationships with our clients, as such, you will be traveling for up to 80% of your time to work onsite at client offices with our current opportunity in Bentonville, Arkansas. And for those who want to make the most of the outdoor activities, growing arts scene and fresh cuisine that Bentonville has to offer, we can also provide support for relocation.



OK, this is all sounding great. But do you have a bullet point list so I can see if I meet the requirements of this opportunity?

We know people are not bullet points but here we go:



Approximately 2+ years of hands-on experience in a highly technical analytics environment, carrying out data science work with large, complex datasets. Bonus points for consulting and retail industry experience.

Medical, dental, vision and life insurance coverage
Flexible spending account
Commuter tax benefit (in Chicago)
Retirement 401(k) plan with 6% employer contribution

COMPANY



LendingTree is the nation's largest online lending marketplace. That means we connect customers with multiple lenders so they find the best deals on loans, credit cards, savings accounts and insurance. Our goal is to help people save money, and we believe the best way to do that is by giving them a way to shop for loans and compare lenders so they make their best financial choices.



Our CEO Doug Lebda founded the company in 1996 after a frustrating house-hunting experience. In those days, we mostly helped people find good mortgage deals. Now, we help consumers find their best in personal loans, auto loans, business loans, student loans, credit cards, savings accounts, home equity loans and more.



What else you should know:


We're a publicly-traded company (TREE).
We've welcomed several other companies into the LendingTree family to augment our efforts at helping borrowers make their most sensible financial choices.
We've built the LendingTree app and My LendingTree dashboard to give consumers tools to manage and monitor their financial health.
We still make funny commercials ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX43xCZV5j0 ).

CULTURE



We're a fast-paced company with an entrepreneurial bend. We work hard and test our products often. We're collaborative, ambitious, candid and high-energy. Our teammates are some of the brightest, most talented people you'll ever work with. We care more about your smarts than we do about the kinds of clothes you wear (but please, do wear clothes to work!), and we're pretty good about rewarding innovation, creativity and the knack for just getting stuff done (we even have an award for employees called the GSD, ""Get Stuff Done"").



Come work with us!

LendingTree is the kind of company that not only promotes diversity and inclusion; we thrive because of these values. We do not discriminate based on race, color, religion (or creed), gender, gender expression, age, national origin, disability, marital status, sexual orientation or military status."

An SEI Consultant is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI consultants keenly understand how to adjust their approach based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, our consultants possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.
As super-connectors, our consultants connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences.

As every project is different, an SEI Consultant must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. An SEI Consultant must be at ease with ambiguity because although a client knows that a problem exists – they need SEI to figure it out and drive a solution. SEI Consultants define ambition differently. SEI Consultants are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who like to hang out with colleagues outside of work. Whether it be cooking, traveling, hiking, or volunteering, SEI Consultants enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends and family.

About CloudQuant

The explosion of alternative data, machine learning and big data technology have spawned a revolution in systematic and fundamental investing. As systematic investors descend from the clouds of purely statistical analysis and encroach upon the terrain formerly occupied exclusively by fundamental analysts, it creates an evolutionary show-down between fundamental and systematic investors which will take place at the quantamental investment cross-roads. This is where legions from both camps will utilize, in different ways, the alternative data to capture the finite amount of alpha in the world. CloudQuant is the vanguard of this revolution, providing the technology tools and business intelligence consulting services with the only full-stack solution encompassing trading, research, visualization, data science, business analytics, and a point-in-time data access fabric, which will be critical weapons as the search for alpha accelerates. As the systematic investors descend on fundamental catalysts and fundamental investors unleash their insights with more granular alternative datasets it is our mission to provide analytical tools that make a critical difference in this evolutionary endgame in investing.

We use visualization, data science, advanced data APIs, and artificial intelligence. We use alternative data, fundamental data, proprietary data, crowdsourcing, high-resolution backtesting, and high-frequency trading engines. We use Python Notebooks, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing to prove the alpha signals and value in the alternative data sets.

We began as an internal research tool for professional proprietary and systematic traders with extraordinary trading ideas to be able to explore quantitative trading ideas within a trading firm.

In 2016, CloudQuant was established as a stand-alone Technology and Business Analytics firm aimed at serving the needs of the independent market researchers around the world. Today our site attracts people from over 170 countries.



CloudQuant is:


a data showcase for alternative data vendors,
a provider of business analytics tools and services,
a high-performance quantitative research and trading platform,
an educator,
a community for traders, quants, and data scientists,
an investor in profitable strategies
a PaaS technology provider,

We are The Data Showcase and The Trading Strategy Incubator. Our mission is to provide quantitative researchers with tools to develop and prove investment and trading strategies."
