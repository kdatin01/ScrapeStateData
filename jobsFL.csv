An SEI Consultant is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI consultants keenly understand how to adjust their approach based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, our consultants possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.
As super-connectors, our consultants connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences.

As every project is different, an SEI Consultant must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. An SEI Consultant must be at ease with ambiguity because although a client knows that a problem exists – they need SEI to figure it out and drive a solution. SEI Consultants define ambition differently. SEI Consultants are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who like to hang out with colleagues outside of work. Whether it be cooking, traveling, hiking, or volunteering, SEI Consultants enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends and family.

Supply any computational, statistical, machine learning or modeling capability needed to synthesize from this design actionable recommendations relative to the team’s question
In collaboration with project teams, propose analysis strategies for target discovery, using methods based for instance on differential expression, co-regulation, correlated amplification, recurrent alterations, etc.; in so doing, also help devise statistical metrics for deciding significance, and ranking schemes for integrating data from many sources
Identify targets and biological contexts (e.g., T or B-cell repertoire, immune phenotypes, copy number, mutational, or expression signatures) in which therapies are likely to be beneficial by mining immune, genetic, genomic or screening data
Support biomarker plans (e.g., selection, pharmacodynamics, efficacy) in collaboration with project teams
Candidate's profile:
Master degree or higher in a computational, biostatistical, or bioinformatics related field
1 year of related working experience is required and strong interest in biology and immunological diseases
First-hand multi-parametric data mining experience for target identification and biomarker discovery (for example, multivariate analysis; dimensionality reduction methods; parametric and non-parametric statistical methods; Bayesian statistics; pattern recognition or classification methods)
First-hand experience at integrating publicly or commercially available genetic, genomic, and immune datasets with novel experimental data to identify testable hypotheses
Knowledge of 1 or more technical areas of analytical pipeline development (microarray, RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) sequencing, data integration) would be a plus
Excellent understanding of immunology and hands-on research experience investigating complex lymphoid and/or myeloid cell subsets a plus
Collaborative, self-directed and with a positive, proactive can-do mindset; well-developed communication and presentation skills and a successful track record of collaborating with cross-functional project teams is a plus; excellent interpersonal and team skills; demonstrated ability to lead project-aspects of moderate scope, mapping-out critical path, milestones and timelines with minimal supervision
