Who We Are
NT Concepts is a national security solutions firm that likes to solve hard problems. It’s our thing. We do that by working with some complex clients (you’ve heard of them) on their hardest challenges. Clients with massive, complex data sets. So we get to keep learning, building, and experimenting with the latest technologies. And since life’s too short to spend with difficult people, we hire team members that not only like to solve problems, but that we like to hang out with. Working on big data solutions is as much about the team you work with, as the data itself. Even more so, in our humble opinion.

Responsibilities
Why We’re Both Here - The Work at Hand
One of the most exciting parts of NT Concepts is our rapidly growing data-science team. You’ll be an expert for clients, partnering closely with our team of Developers and Data Engineers to create robust machine learning solutions. You’ll bring your skills to bear to solve complex problems, provide guidance on current and emerging technologies, and drive the future of our data science enterprise. We mostly focus on exploiting geospatial data of all types (because pictures and maps are fun!) with a sprinkling of Natural Language Processing (NLP). We’ve also got some really cool technology partners that add tools to your toolkit.


We love people who dream big, find data fascinating, and understand that’s it’s not just about data: it’s about the science behind it, and how you can use it to solve real-world problems. (Also, if you happen to have some level of talent at, say kick-ball or giant Jenga: bonus points).
Qualifications
Who You Are
Beyond the whole “this person is awesome and I love working with them” piece, there are a few core skills that will help you out here.
Data science is a dynamic and evolving profession – we’re looking for people who love to learn and find unique solutions without being micro-managed: you’ll have the freedom to try new things, test solutions and technologies, and tell us when there’s a better path.
You know your way around a cloud console and have handled some pretty large volumes of data.
You are familiar with a few machine learning frameworks, like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Maybe you have used enterprise products in the past for high throughput data ingestion and analysis.
Ultimately, we need someone who knows their way around data modeling, information extraction, time series forecasting, machine learning algorithms, statistical analysis, or applied mathematics. We realize that data scientists are a diverse breed and we are excited to hear how your unique combination of skills might apply to our current problem sets."

We're looking for the kind of person who will try and solve a problem on their own first, but isn't afraid to ask for help or say ""I don't know.""



Us



The Data Science team at Pivotal is primarily a consulting practice; we are tool agnostic, working with our customers to solve real world problems. Our customers, like us, are cross-disciplinary. We service engagements with use cases running from customer churn to optimization to detecting fraud and misconduct. We are not just doers, we are also educators and enablers.



Your Day



While there is no such thing as a ""typical day"", these are activities we frequently find ourselves doing:




Working with clients to uncover and frame new opportunities for data science. Clients often come to us without a clear understanding of what we can do, so this is our chance to open their eyes to new possibilities for their businesses.
Exploring client datasets, looking for actionable insights we can present.
Engineering features, training models, tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the results. We emphasize rigor, because data science done right at this stage leads to models that shine in production.
Taking the models we build into production. This is an exciting stage for anyone who likes collaborating with engineering teams and seeing their model become real when users interact with it.
Helping our clients develop their internal data science practices, from hiring and recruiting to data capturing, so that they can be successful when we hand off the project.

Required Skills / Experiences




Clear and empathetic communicator. You'll be the one sharing your insights with clients and stakeholders at check-ins, documenting your work, and even explaining your model to client data teams as part of a handoff. As such, communication and empathy are essential parts of your toolkit.
Advanced knowledge of statistical modeling and/or machine learning methods. These are the tools we need to go from analysis to prediction.
Strong programming skills. Left to our own devices most of us work in Python, but learning the client's tech stack is an important part of the job.
Strong exploratory data analysis skills. Every engagement starts with an investigation of the data, and thorough EDA saves us a lot of headaches in the long run.
Some travel is expected, depending on location and skillset. We mostly work out of the Pivotal office closest to the client, but sometimes we have to be on site for an extended period of time.
At least a bachelor's degree in an analytical or technical field. This could be applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, operations research, economics, etc. Higher education welcome and encouraged.

This role will support US government clients that require US citizenship. Given this, US citizenship is required for you to apply.



Desired Skills / Experiences




2+ years of work in a data-centric field (data science or data engineering).
Experience with relational databases.
Exposure and experience working in a Linux environment.
You have a specialization in an area like NLP, optimization, or image processing.
Hands-on experience working in a distributed computing environment or proven theoretical understanding of parallelism.

Pivotal is an Equal Employment Opportunity employer that will consider all qualified applicants, regardless of race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, gender identity or expression, national origin, genetics, age, disability status, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law."

At Capital One, we’re building a leading information-based technology company. Still founder-led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard Fairbank, Capital One is on a mission to help our customers succeed by bringing ingenuity, simplicity, and humanity to banking. We measure our efforts by the success our customers enjoy and the advocacy they exhibit. We are succeeding because they are succeeding.



Guided by our shared values, we thrive in an environment where collaboration and openness are valued. We believe that innovation is powered by perspective and that teamwork and respect for each other lead to superior results. We elevate each other and obsess about doing the right thing. Our associates serve with humility and a deep respect for their responsibility in helping our customers achieve their goals and realize their dreams. Together, we are on a quest to change banking for good.



Senior Associate, Data Scientist



At Capital One, data is at the center of everything we do. When we launched as a startup we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making.



As a Data Scientist at Capital One, you’ll be part of a team that’s leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in distributed computing technologies and operating across billions and billions of customer transactions to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time and agony in their financial lives.

Using Big Data tools (Hadoop, Spark, H2O, AWS) to conduct the analysis of billions of customer transaction records
Writing software to clean and investigate large, messy data sets of numerical and textual data
Integrating with external data sources and APIs to discover interesting trends
Building machine learning models from development through testing and validation to our 30+ million customers in production
Designing rich data visualizations to communicate complex ideas to customers or company leaders
Investigating the impact of new technologies on the future of digital banking and the financial world of tomorrow

The Ideal Candidate will be:


Curious. You ask why, you explore, you're not afraid to blurt out your disruptive idea. You probably know Python, Scala, or R and you’re constantly exploring new open source tools.
Wrangler. You know how to programmatically extract data from a database and an API, bring it through a transformation or two, and model it into human-readable form (ROC curve, map, d3 visualization, Tableau, etc.).
Creative. Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don't frighten you. You’re used to working with abstract data, and you love discovering new narratives in unmined territories.

Twenty-five years after Capital One was started it’s still led by its founder. Be ready to join a community of the smartest people you’ve ever met, who see the customer first, and want to use their data skills to make a difference.



Basic Qualifications:


Bachelor’s Degree plus 2 years of experience in data analytics, or Master’s Degree, or PhD

The data scientist will be responsible for creating models that pertain to our customers' vulnerability to cyber attack given technical details of how the customer's technology infrastructure is set up; and models that pertain to how a customer's business is financially exposed to an attacker exploiting those vulnerabilities. The Data Scientist will report to the Global Chief Technology Officer.



In order to make the models relevant to a specific customer, the successful candidate will have to work with data that considers the current cyber threat environment globally, the customer's exposure to those threats (in terms of their technology infrastructure's configuration) and the financial losses that those threats could cause. Since the models are of a range of possible attacks, considering the personality and motivation of the attacker, as well as the possible responses from the company, the models must produce a range of outputs at different probabilities.



The Buzz on Nehemiah Security



Nehemiah Security is a fast-growing cybersecurity software company with a passion for building great software. We are leading the way in transforming how companies manage their cyber risk. Here's what's important to us: our people, adding value to our customers, innovation, creativity, hard work, persistence, fearlessness, speed, passion, faith, and teamwork. We're growing fast and we're looking for hard working people who are driven by professional and personal growth to help us disrupt the cyber analytics market. Rated as one of the top 25 best places to work in the Washington DC area, Nehemiah Security is an awesome company to join that can help launch and define your career.



What You'll Do




Designing models that can produce both the magnitude and probability of a company losing money due to multiple cyber events
Designing models that can produce both the magnitude and probability of a company incurring indirect, longer term losses related to reputation damage
Designing sensitivity models that can capture the financial effect of the theft of an organization's secrets
Working with the other members of the data science team to build a complete set of models that consider the types of attack, the personalities and motivations of the attacker, the customer infrastructure's resilience to those attacks and the response of the defenders within the customer
Working with the developers and subject matter experts in cybersecurity, IT and business infrastructure in order to design and specify the required inputs to any models, and how to go about gathering them from the customer's environment or the global threat landscape
Working with the development and architecture teams to take proof of concept models and productise them
Working with the QA team to ensure that the outputs of models can be tested and validated when in production

This is a research role – the models that are built as part of this job will go into production in the RQ product. There are significant challenges to overcome in building models that will operate both in a realistic challenge and can operate at scale.



What We Are Looking For In You




A strong background in mathematics (ideally with focus on probability, linear algebra and graph theory)
Experience in building mathematical models of complex systems
The ability to communicate with SMEs in both the technical and business spaces
Experience working with programming languages such as Python, R, Mathematica, or MATLAB

You're practical and understand that a solution might not exist in one place. You are eager to seek out truth from multiple sources.

The FCC has reformed the USF to support further investment in and access to evolving broadband infrastructure, making the programs a primary vehicle to support this critical national priority. USAC, as the administrator of the USF, plays a critical role in supporting the ambitious vision to ensure that all citizens in the United States have access to high-speed broadband. The organization has approximately 500 employees with an operating budget of more than $200 million. USAC works in close partnership with the FCC and other federal and state partners to support the achievement of the USF program goals.

USAC administers the USF programs—High Cost, Lifeline, Rural Health Care, and Schools and Libraries. USAC strives to provide efficient, responsible stewardship of the programs, a key national asset in making important telecommunications and Internet services available to consumers, health care providers, schools, and libraries throughout the United States. The program divisions are supported by additional USAC personnel in Finance, General Counsel, Information Systems, Internal Audit, the Enterprise Program Management Office and Human Resources. Consistent with FCC rules, USAC does not make policy for or interpret unclear provisions of statutes or the FCC’s rules.

Universal service is paid for by contributions from telecommunications carriers, including wireline and wireless companies, and interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol providers, including cable companies that provide voice service, based on an assessment of their interstate and international end- user revenues. These contributions are most typically passed through to consumers through a universal service fee line item on their telephone bills.

Additional information on USF programs can be found at: http://www.usac.org/about/about/who-we-are/default.aspx


USAC offers a comprehensive benefits package, ongoing professional development opportunities, including vacation and sick leave.

Veracity Forecasting and Analysis, an SPA Company, is part of the Joint, Land, Air, and Space Division within SPA. Our unique processes result in authoritative, data-driven analyses that assist enterprise managers in making complicated decisions. We offer our customers proven expertise in descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics; advanced mathematics and computational techniques (a.k.a. data science); and software engineering. Our mission is to help enterprise leaders make complex, fully informed decisions and save money in the process. #CJ #IN123
Responsibilities
Everybody’s view of data science is a little different, and we are no exception. At Veracity, we view data science as a way of understanding “how the world works.” We make assumptions and models then use data of all sorts to validate or disprove them. Our customers ask tough questions about managing their multifaceted enterprises; we build and operate complex models and simulations to provide the answers that best address the decisions they face.


We don’t expect you to come in with all of the subject matter expertise needed to completely understand the data analysis or to create models with the fidelity we require. We do expect you to get there quickly, though. We look for traits such as how you solve problems when you’re stuck. Do you look for creative ways to apply different techniques from tangential disciplines? Do you crack open a book and teach yourself how to do something new? Do you collaborate with your colleagues? If you take initiatives like these, you would fit in well with our team of analysts.


We would love to tell you that we spend all our time developing elaborate algorithms for regression, survival, kernel weighting, etc., but honestly, we spend a lot of time wrangling data. This includes combing data from disparate data systems, manipulating formats, and cleaning—all of which are required to make the modeling happen. For this critical work we need someone who is precise, efficient, and tenacious.

Civis Analytics is looking for an Applied Data Science Lead to join its DC-based political team.



This team will build the next generation of data science for Democratic and progressive organizations, and the Applied Data Science Lead will play a principal role on the team.



Civis' objective this year and next is simple: we want every political client organization to be data-driven and digital first. Here's how you'd help:



First, the Civis platform is the technology of record for hundreds of in-house data scientists and analysts across the progressive movement. We seek to extend the feature set and capabilities to help these users quickly and self-reliantly accomplish their missions through data.



Second, Civis is building new digital technologies to help campaigns make the transition to digital outreach. It's 2019 after all. We're building the measurement, execution, and attribution tools to help these campaigns measure, target, and spend their dollars effectively and transparently through digital tools.



Below are more details, and the application. Even if you want to just hear more, let us know by emailing internalrecruiting@civisanalytics.com and we'll quickly get on the phone with you to discuss more.



What we are looking for



ADS Leads manage, supervise, and mentor a team of Data Scientists to deliver solutions and strategic guidance to progressive organizations. ADS Leads work closely with teams across the company, including social science, engineering, product, legal, finance, and sales. Often they find themselves managing cross-functional teams to advise, oversee, and communicate their work internally and externally. They lead projects from scoping to delivery, work directly with clients to communicate guidance and implement solutions, and identify new opportunities in political analytics. ADS Leads are the public face of Civis.



While this is a politically-focused role, individuals have succeeded in this role with a range of backgrounds outside of direct campaign experience, including consulting experience in a non-political role. Members of our team have educational backgrounds in physics, political science, philosophy, and more.



Minimum Requirements




Excellent interpersonal and communication skills
Demonstrated ability to work under time restrictions
Demonstrated history of delivering high-quality analytic work to decision makers
Demonstrated passion for progressive causes, political data, and/or campaigns
Experience managing teams to complete projects within scope and on time
Able to communicate effectively about statistics, survey research, and/or predictive modeling, in addition to providing leadership and support to junior staff
Calm demeanor and eagerness to work in a cross-functional environment where methodology and client needs shift over time
Bachelor's degree in an analytical subject or equivalent experience with data and analytics, which can include skills developed in a past job, on a political campaign, or through self-driven learning
US work authorization required

Preferred Qualifications




Expertise with statistical packages (R, Python, etc) and/or SQL
Experience managing a team of technical staff
A cycle or more of electoral campaign experience, preferably in data or analytics
Experience working for a consulting, services, or advisory firm
Experience writing proposals, building cost and pricing estimates of proposed work, and selling the work to new or existing clients
Experience working with a diverse team, fostering an inclusive workplace, and bringing a sensitivity and appreciation of cultural differences
Experience presenting completed work or pitching new work to high-level or executive audiences
Advanced degree in an analytical subject (statistics, math, economics, physics, business, etc.) or Masters in Business Administration

Compensation for this role ranges from $110,000 - $150,000 based on experience.



Why Civis Analytics?




The opportunity to be part of a growing tech startup focused on continued learning, mentorship, and internal promotion
Competitive benefits including flexible PTO, 401K match with immediate vesting, as well as health, dental, and vision benefits
Downtown open office environment near great restaurants and all public transportation options

Our products, services, and culture benefit from and thrive on the unique perspectives brought by each person in our Civis community.

Calling all quantitative marketing people with a data science background! We are in the market for a talented machine learning guru with a strong feel for consumer data. The good news is that data is not the heart of our business, it IS our business. Founded by Rob McGovern, a serial entrepreneur who founded CareerBuilder.com, Precise Target is first and foremost, a data science company helping retailers acquire, engage and reactivate inactive customers. We've taken a programmatic approach, using billions of SKUs and consumer transactions to create the first cross-merchant taste graphs (recommended product sets) for individual customers and we want you, as a Data Scientist, to help us improve on its stability and increase its value to our customers helping them move more product through their ecommerce channels.


Who We Are
We are a small vibrant team and we thrive on diversity. We’re the opposite of the hoodie wearing start-up living in a cave. Half of our engineers are women, our office looks more like an ad agency (it’s a former Starbucks regional office), we don’t think adults should have to worry about counting vacation days, and our outdoor terrace is a favorite refuge and a great place to catch some rays and indulge your green thumb. Our walkability index is 100%+: convenient to metro, seven coffee shops are within three blocks for our coffee obsessed employees, the women’s farmer cooperative is right next door, and we’ll pay for your commute, whether you metro, drive, walk, or ride your bike.
Responsibilities
What You’ll Do
You will design, develop, test, deploy and maintain machine learning techniques that will expand the breadth of our product offering. The products run on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and use terabytes of retail and buying data. You will be responsible for:
Automating statistical quality assurance tests.
Automating classification modeling and segmentation.
Acting as an internal subject-matter expert for new statistics and machine learning techniques by remaining up to date on current applicable machine learning techniques and their associated programing methods and value.
Qualifications
You are a data geek with:
At least 5 years of experience in working with online buying - ecommerce, product, or retail analytics.
Intimate understanding of complex data sets, including product data, product categories, taxonomies and related metadata elements.
Programming skills in R, python, or other statistical tools.
Proficiency in Agile methodology with strong business analysis skills.


You probably have a degree in a quantitative field (math, statistics, engineering, or library sciences) and maybe advanced training in analytics. You ARE smart.

What Else You Should Know
We know you work for love, but you also need to eat. So we’ve put together a package that will hopefully feed you and your soul.
The pay is great, bordering on insanely high.
Stock options for your wealth plan.
Vacation: liberal design-it-yourself plan.
Free lunch 4 days a week.
Over 200 restaurants within walking distance.
An environment that will make you say you’re working with brilliant people
Commuting expenses allowance, even if you ride your bike.

What Now? If you are someone with a bias towards problem-solving, a well-known ability to figure it out yourself, secure in what you know and don’t know, and possess an ability to hold your own in a room of hotshots who built our system from the ground up 4 years ago, let’s talk. We’re all ears."
