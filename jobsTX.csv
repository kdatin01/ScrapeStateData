The Supply Chain Optimization Technologies (SCOT) team is a machine learning powerhouse providing the brainpower behind the Amazon supply chain and using artificial intelligence to grow the most complex retail networks in the world. The team is composed of scientists, engineers, and researchers who lead the industry in the development of innovative algorithms and optimization strategies to maximize the long term effectiveness of Amazon’s Retail business.

This team works to extend existing and build new algorithms and systems to achieve an ideal inventory position, maximizing in-stock selection on behalf of our customers and growing our Seller’s businesses. We own and operate production systems that decide the most optimal strategy to ship a customer order, simulation systems that allow internal customers experiment with what-if scenarios and analytical systems to help understand results and derive intelligence from the same.



The team in Austin is focused on using cutting edge science to improve customer outcomes and transform our logistics, along with machine learning, and scalable distributed software in the cloud that automates and optimizes shipments to customers under the uncertainty of demand, pricing and supply. When customers place orders, our systems use real time, large scale optimization techniques to optimally choose from where to ship and how to consolidate multiple orders so that customers get their shipments on time or faster with the lowest possible transportation costs.



As the Fulfillment Insights team, one of our core responsibilities is to leverage big data to identify key patterns of success and failure, identify the areas we need to focus on first, understand root cause(s) that triggered failure, and to build predictive models that will help fix the most impactful problems. The amount of data, the variables that come into play, and diversity of customers and locations make this role very challenging and also fun. It's great for those who love solving problems, especially when dealing with a lot of ambiguity and asking lots of smart questions that will lead to the discovery of universal concepts, and truly innovative ML solutions that continuously improve the customer delivery experience. Every member of the team needs to have independent thinking, a burning desire to learn, and the skills and experience needed to build science and technology so advanced that it will appear to generate “magical outcomes”.



As part of your daily work you will:

Analyze and extract relevant information from large amounts of data to help automate and optimize key processes.Design, development and evaluation of highly innovative models for predictive learning.Think about customers and how to improve the customer delivery experienceUse machine learning and analytical techniques to create scalable solutions for business problems.Work closely with data & software engineering teams to build model implementations and integrate successful models and algorithms in production systems at very large scale.Technically lead and mentor other scientists in team.Establish scalable, efficient, automated processes for large scale data analyses, model development, model validation and model implementation.Research and implement novel machine learning and statistical approaches.

Who We AreWe’re NT Concepts, a leading provider of business and technology solutions for the intelligence and national security communities! Our team of engineers, subject matter experts, and data scientists provide experienced, high-quality Information Technology (IT) and cybersecurity engineering and innovation support. We do that by working with some complex clients on their hardest challenges. Clients with massive, complex data sets. So we get to keep learning, building, and keeping our skills sharp. And since life’s too short to spend with difficult people, we hire team members that not only like to solveproblems, but that we like so hang out with. That's important.RESPONSIBILITIES
And… Why We’re Both Here - This “Job” ThingHere it is: we have some opportunities. And we’d like to get to know some more amazing people, that might want to talk about that. People like you. Since you’re reading this, and the title’s “data scientist,” we’re thinking you might be a little interested. Very cool.We love people who dream big, find data fascinating, and understand that’s it’s not just about data: it’s about the science behind it, and how you can use it to solve real-world problems. We've got some tricky time-series data on this particular project and are looking for creative minds in the deep learning space to tackle it. (Also, if you happen to have some level of talent at, say kick-ball or giant Jenga: bonus points).QUALIFICATIONS
Who You AreOkay, beyond the basics (you solve problems, and are generally nice), we’re looking for a few skills. Less concerned with the specific technologies (great scientists can learn new tech as it emerges), more about horsepower.. That said, here are a couple bullets, things we look for:Data science is a dynamic and evolving profession – we’re looking for people who love to learn and find unique solutions without being micro-managed: you’ll have the freedom to try new things, test solutions and technologies, and tell us when there’s a better path.You know your way around a cloud console and have handled some pretty large volumes of data (time-series a plus!).You are familiar with a few machine learning frameworks, like TensorFlow or PyTorch.You've got experience with deep learning.Maybe you have used enterprise products in the past for high throughput data ingestion and analysis.Ultimately, we need someone who knows their way around data modeling, information extraction, time-series forecasting, machine learning algorithms, statistical analysis, or applied mathematics.We realize that data scientists are a diverse breed and we are excited to hear how your unique combination of skills might apply to our current problem setsRequired:Secret clearance required, higher clearance preferredBachelor's degree in a technical fieldJob Type: Full-timeWork authorization:United States (Required)Work Location:One location"

Job Description
About this role
Arm is the leading designer of the microprocessors, graphics chips, and other hardware and software that power the world’s mobile devices. Arm’s Research division works to create new technologies that Arm will use to keep its products innovative and competitive in the future.
Within Arm Research in Austin, Texas, the Computational Engineering group is using machine learning (ML) and data science (DS) to enhance Arm’s hardware and software engineering capabilities. As a member of this group, you will develop research ideas all the way from data extraction through algorithm development and prototype flow creation. Your work will result in tangible improvements like the reduction of the engineering effort and computing time needed to create Arm’s most advanced products. And you’ll be free to strike your own balance between practical work, publication, and more speculative research, as long as the overall result benefits Arm’s business. Our goal is to help human engineers and ML algorithms work seamlessly together, producing results that neither could achieve alone.
What will I do in this role?


Build ML applications from the ground up, in partnership with stakeholders such as engineers and managers
Communicate with stakeholders to understand their problems, devise feasible ML solutions and help evaluate the resulting gains
Collaborate with production engineers to deploy the results of your research across Arm
Assess your own work and that of colleagues rigorously and critically to establish and spread ML best practices across Arm
Find opportunities to present your work outside Arm; learn new techniques and bring that knowledge into Arm
Engage in academic research and publication, as desired and appropriate
Job Requirements
What skills, experience and qualifications do I need?
Master's or Ph.D. in a quantitative or analytical field; no engineering background is required
Minimum 2 years of research experience working end-to-end on sizable, data-intensive projects

The ability to communicate complex technical ideas and results clearly and persuasively
The ability to give and receive well-considered and helpful feedback to improve our team’s technical and communication skills


Desired behaviors for this role:
Arm is proud to have a set of behaviors that reflect our visionary culture and guide our decisions, defining how we work together to defy ordinary and craft extraordinarily. These behaviors are assessed during the recruitment process:



We Not I
Take daily responsibility to make the Global Arm community thrive
No individual is responsible for the right answer. Brilliance is collective
Information is crucial, share it
Realize that we win when we collaborate — and that everyone misses out when we don’t
Passion for Progress
Our differences are our strength. Widen and mix up the pool of people you connect
Difficult things can take unexpected directions. Stick with it. Make feedback positive and expansive, not negative and narrow
The essence of progress is that it can’t stop. Grow with it and be responsible for your own progress
Be Your Brilliant Self
Be quirky not egocentric
Recognize the power in saying ‘I don’t know""
Make trust our default position
Hold strong opinions lightly

1.1.1.1 ( https://1.1.1.1/ ): We released 1.1.1.1 ( https://1.1.1.1/ ) to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver.

You have a solid understanding of the framework internals, including the linear algebra, neural network computational logic, stochastic optimization, and hardware acceleration.
You have deep experience in probabilistic reasoning and computational problem solving and a healthy dose of obsession about accuracy, reliability, robustness, and scalability. You are very comfortable diving deep into topics such as Bayesian ML, autoencoders, generative models, adversarial training, etc.
You possess the ability to see the big picture, question the norm, and articulate the problem.
You can translate relatively abstract ideas into concrete workable solutions.
You enjoy experimenting with cutting-edge technologies that may be relatively immature at the time of their use.
You are good in identifying the technology trade-offs and can synthesize pragmatic solutions to the problems at hand by judiciously leveraging published and open-source technologies.
You are a strong programmer and are not afraid to dive in large code bases. You take pride in your code and enjoy contributing to open source projects.
Job Requirements

Take daily responsibility to make the Global Arm community thrive
No individual owns the right answer. Brilliance is collective
Information is important, share it
Realize that we win when we collaborate — and that everyone misses out when we don’t
Passion for Progress


Our differences are our strength. Widen and mix up the pool of people you connect with
Difficult things can take unexpected directions. Stick with it
Make feedback positive and expansive, not negative and narrow
The essence of progress is that it can’t stop. Grow with it and own your own progress
Be your Brilliant Self
Be quirky not egocentric
Recognize the power in saying ‘I don’t know’
Make trust our default position
Hold strong opinions lightly

About CyberFortress
CyberFortress was formed to be a new kind of company to tackle a big problem. Insurance is one of the most painful and hated experiences in modern life. We want to change that. But we don’t think we can change the insurance industry without first changing ourselves. So we have thrown out a lot of the startup playbook: No founder dictators. No managers. No vesting handcuffs. No work obsession leading to burnout. No living in a future that doesn’t exist.
We are a community of owners engaged in a common project and governed through thoughtful and open debate rather than top-down managers. We want every employee-owner to have a rich life of which work is an integral and fulfilling part."
