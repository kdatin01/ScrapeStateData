Cures Start Here. At Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, home to three Nobel laureates, interdisciplinary teams of world-renowned scientists seek new and innovative ways to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, HIV/AIDS and other life-threatening diseases. Fred Hutch’s pioneering work in bone marrow transplantation led to the development of immunotherapy, which harnesses the power of the immune system to treat cancer. An independent, nonprofit research institute based in Seattle, Fred Hutch houses the nation’s first cancer prevention research program, as well as the clinical coordinating center of the Women’s Health Initiative and the international headquarters of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network. Careers Start Here.

The Innovation Laboratory (iLab) at Fred Hutch is seeking a Masters- or PhD-level data scientist. The iLab is a new collaborative initiative of the Immunotherapy and Translational Data Science Integrated Research Centers (IIRC and TDS_IRC) with a mission to advance the introduction and development of new immuno-oncology research technologies. The iLab will spur in-house development and early adoption of novel techniques, including advanced single cell RNA spatial sequencing, T- and B-cell receptor sequencing, and other DNA/RNA-based technologies. The data scientist will work closely with lab personnel and immunotherapy researchers to develop data analysis methods for new technologies.

Over the past three years, Fred Hutch has launched three Integrated Research Centers (IRCs) to increase collaborative research across the Center and stimulate transformative cancer discovery. The IIRC, led by Dr. Stanley Riddell, and the TDS_IRC, led by Dr. Raphael Gottardo, have joined together and created the iLab to speed adoption of novel technologies, particularly those that generate large datasets of high utility to immunotherapy. The successful candidate will be embedded in the iLab, but will also have close ties to the Gottardo Lab and the TDS_IRC. The iLab will initially be housed in the Bielas Lab. Working closely with Drs. Bielas and Gottardo, the successful candidate will function with a high degree of independence as they manage daily activities. We see the integration of computational work within the iLab as an integral part of its success, providing computational innovation.

As a Fred Hutch strategic initiative, we value inclusion and a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives to inform our work. We believe in supporting each other through mentorship and providing resources for professional development. Given these values, we strive to make our recruitment and promotion processes fair and transparent. Therefore, we strongly encourage all individuals with an interest in the position to apply. To learn more about the IRCs: Immunotherapy ; Translational Data Science

We are seeking a Masters- or PhD-level data scientist to work with the iLab to develop workflows and data analysis pipelines, from novel genomics technologies developed in-house to collaboration with select industry partners. The data scientist may also support some projects more broadly, creating workflows and analyses that also include data sets generated outside of the iLab, clinical data, and other translation data sources. The ideal candidate will support large collaborative projects in a wide range of problems in oncology research and serve as a consultant/link between the iLab, laboratory and clinical scientists. The incumbent will collaborate with laboratory-based scientists, clinical investigators, biostatisticians, data scientists, programmers and computational biologists in two ways:
As member of the iLab, creating novel workflows and data analysis pipelines for novel technologies being tested and developed in the laboratory.
As a contributing member on teams using novel technologies in the iLab, creating and using computational tools for analyzing clinical and pre-clinical samples.
Through these multi-disciplinary collaborations, the data scientist will support and expand opportunities to apply novel tools and technologies to innovative pre-clinical and clinical studies.
Responsibilities
Consult with Fred Hutch researchers collaborating with iLab to solve their data science problems
Manage and set scientific priorities across projects
Develop and optimize computational pipelines to enable the integration and management of large and complex data sets generated in the iLab

The mission of the Systems Intelligence team is to provide situational awareness to Amazon’s leaders enabling them to make decisions that will directly impact the culture of software development. A Sr. Data Scientist is critical to the success of this program to analyze the data we collect and provide statistical correlations that will drive future business decisions. Our team must provide visibility into the metadata collected from Amazon’s internal systems, software development tools, developer output metrics, and internal surveys to highlight differences across organizations. These variances will help drive discussions and investigations into areas that present potential bottlenecks or risks to software delivery. Based on the learnings from these investigations, we will identify best practices that can be shared with all levels of the organization to drive continuous improvement. A Sr. Data Scientist will complete the feedback cycle for our team, synthesizing the data we collect, providing correlation analysis, and guiding future investigations.

As a Data Scientist, your role will be to leverage the past data to make future predictions, thereby helping us mitigate the uncertainty of the future by making predictions of future performance. While business intelligence tends to be structured, data science leans more toward the unstructured. You must deal with incomplete, messy, unorganized data, not immediately usable without some degree of cleaning and prepping. You will generate predictive insights and new product innovations by applying advanced analytical tools and algorithms utilizing advanced statistical packages, SQL, Hadoop, and open source tools like Python and Perl.



In 2019, our team will deliver a dashboard for software development managers that provides in depth insights and business metrics about their teams, providing historical trending analysis along with comparisons against organizational averages, guiding managers toward improvement opportunities in development agility. By gathering datasets such as deployments, code submissions, code reviews, and team hierarchy, the dashboard will also provide a view for technical leaders to drive crosscutting initiatives such as SDE Ratios, remote code contributions, and migration to native AWS. Success will be measured by providing a dashboard built on Systems Intelligence (our internal data lake) that improves development agility. Examples include quantifying the efficiency gained by migrating to optimized platforms (pre-compute queries and deployment automation) along with identifying teams that could benefit from leveraging these services. Other examples include enabling teams to track increases in deployment velocity, increase in code coverage, and/or reduction in technical debt. With the cost of engineering resources constantly on the rise, leaders must seek opportunities to increase the efficiency of software development. Attempting to quantify software agility and baseline the maturity of software development teams has been a long-standing challenge because of the complexity in the development process and various forms of output. Providing visibility into the outcome of software development enables teams to identify maturity opportunities within their own processes and better understand the impact of changes.

Intelligent machines powered by Artificial Intelligence computers that can learn, reason and interact with people are no longer science fiction. Today, a self-driving car powered by AI can meander through a country road at night and find its way. An AI-powered robot can learn motor skills through trial and error — this is truly an extraordinary time and the era of AI has begun.
Image recognition and speech recognition — GPU Deep Learning has provided the foundation for machines to learn, perceive, reason and solve problems. The GPU started out as the engine for simulating human creativity, conjuring up the amazing virtual worlds of video games and Hollywood films. Now, Nvidia’s GPU runs Deep Learning algorithms, simulating human intelligence, and acts as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. Just as human imagination and intelligence are linked, computer graphics and AI come together in our architecture. Two modes of the human brain, two modes of the GPU. This may explain why Nvidia GPUs are used broadly for Deep Learning, and Nvidia is increasingly known as “the AI computing company.” Make the choice to join us today.
Our team is building the Map Perception component of the NVIDIA DriveWorks SDK, with the goal to build a scalable crowd-sourced mapping platform for autonomous driving, that will enable a fleet of autonomous vehicles to create and consume map data collaboratively.
We are seeking software engineers with interests in computer vision, mapping, LiDAR perception, deep learning, sensor fusion, and other related areas, to work as part of NVIDIA’s autonomous vehicles team.
What You'll Be Doing:
Taking algorithms from initial evaluation and experimentation all the way to shipping them as part of the NVIDIA DriveWorks SDK and related products.
Developing and optimizing software architecture for real-world performance while matching or exceeding customer requirements.
Working on areas such as sensor self-calibration, vehicle ego-motion, perception, mapping and localization using a variety of sensor modalities (Camera, LiDAR, Radar, INS, GPS, Odometry, etc.).
Collecting map data, working on storage systems, fusing and mining data, integrating into a cloud-based service.
Solidifying existing algorithms, and working with large amounts of real and synthetic data to continuously improve the algorithmic and computational performance.
Performing in-vehicle tests, capturing data and completing autonomous drive missions.
Developing unit tests, documentation for features, evaluating quality and proposing corrective actions.
Developing highly efficient product code in C++, making use of high algorithmic parallelism offered by GPGPU programming (CUDA). Code written must comply to strict quality and safety standards such as defined by MISRA.
What We Need To See:
Currently pursuing a MS or PhD degree in Computer Science, Robotics, or related field.
To be successful you should have experience in one or more of the following areas: Computer vision, visual geometry, LIDAR perception, SLAM and/or deep learning.
Experience building robust software.
Have strong programming and debugging skills in C++ and real-time multi-threaded software development.
Good communications and analytical skills. Ability to work with multiple multi-functional teams across multiple time zones.
Ways To Stand Out From The Crowd:
Experience developing real-time LIDAR Perception and/or Computer Vision systems and / or scalable cloud based mapping solutions.
Experience fusing data from different sensor modalities (e.g. Images and LIDAR data) to enable information conflation, label propagation, cross training for deep learning.
Experience with visual geometry and deep learning in a shipping product context.
Software development on embedded platforms or large scale cloud services.
Experience with GPGPU programming (CUDA and OpenCL).
We believe that realizing self-driving cars will be a defining contribution of our generation (e.g. traffic accidents are responsible for ~1.25 million deaths per year world-wide). We have the funding and scale, but we need your help on our team.

NVIDIA is committed to fostering a diverse work environment and proud to be an equal opportunity employer. As we highly value diversity in our current and future employees, we do not discriminate (including in our hiring and promotion practices) on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender expression , sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, disability status or any other characteristic protected by law.

Our team uses a variety of data mining and analysis methods, a variety of data tools, builds and implements models, develops algorithms, and creates simulations. Team members must be very comfortable writing production-ready code to include testing and maintenance infrastructure, and able to put models and analysis into production with no support from engineering (we own our stack end to end). At Assurance, we hire experts in their field, and we give them the independence and trust to build based on their expertise.

To be successful in this role, you must possess the following:
Proficiency in either Python or R, and expertise in SQL.
Experience working with AWS or another cloud-based computing platform.
Experience and working knowledge of data infrastructure, pipelines, and advanced data manipulation.
Experience with BI tools like Tableau or Looker (preferred), or any other industry tool such Qlik, PowerBI, Spotfire, etc.
Excellent communication ability – you can explain your work in a way that anyone on the team can understand, and you can frame problems in a way that ensures the right question is being asked.
Business Acumen – you are always eager to understand how the business works, and more specifically, how your work impacts the business.
Enthusiastic yet humble – you are excited about the work you do, but you are also humble enough to embrace feedback – you don’t need to be the smartest person in the room.
The following additional experience is desired:
Experience retraining a model within a few days or update a model within one day.
Capable of performing an in-depth analysis and summarizing findings in one day.
Comfortable having conversations with our executive team and non-technical team members to distill down their needs and to deliver actionable insights.
About You
You have a proven ability to drive business results with data-based insights and are comfortable working with a wide range of stakeholders and functional teams. The right candidate will have a passion for discovering solutions hidden in large data sets and working with stakeholders to improve business outcomes. You’re capable of getting data for analysis on your own, without reliance on engineering, and you can build professional dashboards as standalone software products and tools. We’re growing at a rapid pace, so it’s important that you embrace the opportunity to blaze your own trail. You thrive in a fast-paced environment where priorities can shift rapidly as we corner opportunity. You can work independently, with little oversight or guidance.

If this sounds like a good fit for you, give us a shout, we’d love to chat!"

As Messenger and Messenger Lite continues to expand to all corners of the world, having performant apps matters more than ever. The vast majority of our users access Messenger using old devices and unreliable networks, and bad performance leads to less engaged users and a poor user experience. In this role you will be working closely with the team responsible for making sure the Messenger app delivers the best possible performance across iOS, Android and Web platforms. Our team works cross-functionally with product and infrastructure teams across Messenger to improve app start time, scrolling performance as well as reduce crashes and minimize resources consumption. We’re looking for a thought leader in this space to help us frame up and prioritize all the performance investments that we’re making across the company. This position will directly engage with the CTO for the Messenger app and have the opportunity to directly shape our investments and roadmap for the next 3 years. Some key challenges we’re looking to solve in the next year include: How often do users have a “bad experience” while using the app? How can we quantify this and how does it affect engagement? What sectors of the population are the most sensitive to performance regressions and how should we adapt our strategy as a result? How should we prioritize our efforts across different users and performance metrics to deliver the best possible performing app?

Zillow is looking for an extraordinary Data Scientist to join a growing team. Zillow is on a mission to give consumers certainty and control when selling their home. In particular, using our unparalleled data, and view into housing markets, to help build a world-class platform for real estate marketplace optimization. In the Zillow Offers product, Zillow buys homes directly from interested homeowners, thereby sparing them the tremendous stress and effort of selling. Instead, we take that upon ourselves by quickly preparing these homes for the market and sell them to buyers. This is a key initiative at Zillow as we aim to define the future of real estate. This product isn’t viable for everyone (yet). When that’s the case, we want to make sure we still help consumers sell their home.

Our team is tasked with absorbing dozens, sometimes billions, of rows of data from various sources, organizing them, analyzing them, and visualizing them to help inform both short- and long-term decision-making. Our structure is very flat and you will soon find yourself communicating directly with Senior Leadership. Each team member focuses on a cross-section of the Zillow Offers organization.
About the role
Once you are here, you'll work to make important, strategic decisions that influence the direction of the company. More specifically:
You will dive into Zillow's internal and third party data (think Hive, Presto, SQL Server, Redshift, Python, Mode Analytics, Tableau, R) to make strategic recommendations (e.g., personalized user flows, segmented marketing audiences, more accurate pricing forecasts).
You will lead analytical efforts to develop scalable and methodologically rigorous approaches to performance measurement (e.g., AB testing, incrementality testing), forecasting, and other applications of advanced analytics.
You will serve as a mentor to other Data Scientists on the team and Analysts across the company by leading learning academies and serving as an available resource for all things related to analytics.
You will mature a common language and approach to analyzing and communicating information and insights across teams.
You will tell stories that describe analytical results and insights in meetings of all sizes with diverse audiences.
You will provide thought leadership across a variety of technical and non-technical audiences to ensure that all levels of Zillow Group make decision with an analytical foundation.
Who you are
You will not shy away from complexity or uncertainty. You will develop a deep understanding of our mission, business models, and personas. We want you to use that intuition you've developed (both in business and real life) to find opportunities for growth and cultivate insights from our massive data sets. We're looking for a seasoned data scientist. We expect:
You have an undergraduate or Master's degree in a quantitative field (e.g. science, engineering, economics, finance, statistics, or similar).
You have 2+ years of work experience involving quantitative data analysis and complex problem solving.
You have complete command of SQL, Excel, and either Python or R, along with some experience with Tableau and/or Mode.
You have extensive experience directly querying multi-terabyte-sized data sets (with Hive and Presto) including clickstream data (like Google Analytics), third party data (like Facebook) and raw data ingested from non-standard platforms.
You have practice with terminology, and measurement issues related to experimentation, along with a history of applying advanced analytical approaches to derive insights from the data.
You have strong written, verbal, and visual communication skills to concisely communicate in a way that provides context, offers insights, and minimizes misinterpretation.
You have the skills to work cross-functionally and push business partners to focus on realistic goals and projects.

Our founding promise to the community is as valid today as it was over a century ago: we will care for all children in our region, regardless of the families’ ability to pay. Together, we deliver superior patient care, advance new discoveries and treatments through pediatric research, and serve as the pediatric and adolescent, academic medical center for Washington, Alaska, Montana and Idaho – the largest region of any children’s hospital in the country.


In 2018, U.S. News & World Report once again ranked Seattle Children’s among the nation's best children's hospitals – for the 26th year in a row. We received national rankings in all 10 specialty areas evaluated by U.S. News & World Report, and are honored to be the only pediatric medical center in Washington to be ranked.


As a Magnet designated institution, we recognize the importance of hiring and developing great talent to provide best-in-class care to the patients and families we serve. Our organizational DNA takes form in our core values: Compassion, Excellence, Integrity, Collaboration, Equity and Innovation. Whether it’s delivering frontline care to our patients in a kind and caring way, practicing the highest standards of quality and safety or being relentlessly curious as we work towards eradicating childhood diseases, these values are the fabric of our culture and community.

Cures Start Here. At Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, home to three Nobel laureates, interdisciplinary teams of world-renowned scientists seek new and innovative ways to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, HIV/AIDS and other life-threatening diseases. Fred Hutch’s pioneering work in bone marrow transplantation led to the development of immunotherapy, which harnesses the power of the immune system to treat cancer. An independent, nonprofit research institute based in Seattle, Fred Hutch houses the nation’s first cancer prevention research program, as well as the clinical coordinating center of the Women’s Health Initiative and the international headquarters of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network. Careers Start Here.

The Innovation Laboratory (iLab) at Fred Hutch is seeking a Masters- or PhD-level data scientist. The iLab is a new collaborative initiative of the Immunotherapy and Translational Data Science Integrated Research Centers (IIRC and TDS_IRC) with a mission to advance the introduction and development of new immuno-oncology research technologies. The iLab will spur in-house development and early adoption of novel techniques, including advanced single cell RNA spatial sequencing, T- and B-cell receptor sequencing, and other DNA/RNA-based technologies. The data scientist will work closely with lab personnel and immunotherapy researchers to develop data analysis methods for new technologies.

Over the past three years, Fred Hutch has launched three Integrated Research Centers (IRCs) to increase collaborative research across the Center and stimulate transformative cancer discovery. The IIRC, led by Dr. Stanley Riddell, and the TDS_IRC, led by Dr. Raphael Gottardo, have joined together and created the iLab to speed adoption of novel technologies, particularly those that generate large datasets of high utility to immunotherapy. The successful candidate will be embedded in the iLab, but will also have close ties to the Gottardo Lab and the TDS_IRC. The iLab will initially be housed in the Bielas Lab. Working closely with Drs. Bielas and Gottardo, the successful candidate will function with a high degree of independence as they manage daily activities. We see the integration of computational work within the iLab as an integral part of its success, providing computational innovation.

As a Fred Hutch strategic initiative, we value inclusion and a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives to inform our work. We believe in supporting each other through mentorship and providing resources for professional development. Given these values, we strive to make our recruitment and promotion processes fair and transparent. Therefore, we strongly encourage all individuals with an interest in the position to apply. To learn more about the IRCs: Immunotherapy ; Translational Data Science

We are seeking a Masters- or PhD-level data scientist to work with the iLab to develop workflows and data analysis pipelines, from novel genomics technologies developed in-house to collaboration with select industry partners. The data scientist may also support some projects more broadly, creating workflows and analyses that also include data sets generated outside of the iLab, clinical data, and other translation data sources. The ideal candidate will support large collaborative projects in a wide range of problems in oncology research and serve as a consultant/link between the iLab, laboratory and clinical scientists. The incumbent will collaborate with laboratory-based scientists, clinical investigators, biostatisticians, data scientists, programmers and computational biologists in two ways:
As member of the iLab, creating novel workflows and data analysis pipelines for novel technologies being tested and developed in the laboratory.
As a contributing member on teams using novel technologies in the iLab, creating and using computational tools for analyzing clinical and pre-clinical samples.
Through these multi-disciplinary collaborations, the data scientist will support and expand opportunities to apply novel tools and technologies to innovative pre-clinical and clinical studies.
Responsibilities
Consult with Fred Hutch researchers collaborating with iLab to solve their data science problems
Manage and set scientific priorities across projects
Develop and optimize computational pipelines to enable the integration and management of large and complex data sets generated in the iLab
Test and potentially develop open-source software for reproducible research
Interpret results from computational and statistical analysis
Assist with study design and analysis of pre-clinical and clinical trials
Participate in the dissemination of research findings
